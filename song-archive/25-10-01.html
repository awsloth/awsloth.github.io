            <p>Wow has it been a long time since I wrote one of these. I've been
            kinda stressed and busy with other writing (my summer research project)
            so I've not really felt the pull of more writing on the side. It's kinda
            funny that I've decided to do one now given the deadline for that is
            tomorrow (and I haven't finished it!), but hey the mind wants to write
            when it wants to write. With that said let's dive right into some songs
            shall we?</p>
            <p>First up: Dry Cleaning. If you're a regular fan of my song of the
            week you know I like post-punk and one of the typical features here is
            some really talk-y vocals. Take that and turn it up to a million and
            then you'll have Dry Cleaning. The vocalist, Florence Shaw, would almost
            sounds like she was reading the lyrics from a book were it not for the
            different quirks in tone and spacing between lines. It's weird and
            strange but fun, especially combined with the often bizarre lyrics and
            stories told in the songs.</p>
            <p>Perhaps my first introduction to Dry Cleaning can express to you the
            oddness they give off. This is the song <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/04P3v2iz7oF416UeDnvGZW?si=42373c3fff234f28">Goodnight</a>,
            from their second EP; Sweet Princess. The lyrics are formed of youtube
            comments from aphex twin songs. These are so out there and zoning in and
            really listening to the lyrics you can only laugh sometimes.</p>
            <p>Another favourite of mine is <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0v1E9THk87pvNNlCpDP3js?si=ccd74aae1c59470c">Tony
            Speaks!</a>. If you want some more recommendations from their
            discography let me know!</p>
            <p>Anyway all this listening to Dry Cleaning I was doing must have done
            something, because they announcemed a new album and dropped a single
            just this week! I really recommend you listen to the new single <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0JIKmYZmtDKqXAU37ZqwbN?si=da4ebd922885408c">Hit
            My Head All Day</a>. I had it on repeat all of Monday and it's such an
            earworm.</p>
            <p>Now for the song of the week. As I said earlier, I've been pretty
            stressed lately, with uni starting up again and projects creeping up
            again, so I've needed some different music to calm down. Mainly because
            I cannot listen to my normal music when I feel stressed. Somehow I
            stumbled across this album by Laurie Torres and wow was it just what I
            needed. It's a collection of instrumental tracks d with a main focus on
            piano, synth and drums. In particular like <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/25yXIpb5rqudma0hQIHc5v?si=59324b147e7d4a78">Intérieurs</a>,
            the drums and piano mix so well together in the most fun and fluid way,
            but my favourite has to be the first track off of the album, Duvet,
            which is my song of the week. It starts slow with synth building up,
            this feels kinda of reminiscient to some of Ethel Cain, though with
            perhaps a more light tone. The piano is playful and dances on top of the
            delicate synth in the background. I don't know what it is about the
            track exactly, but it just works right now and that's what matters.</p>
