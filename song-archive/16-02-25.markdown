One song I am currently really enjoying is "I've Never Met Anyone I Thought I Could Really Love (Until I Met You)" by Westside Cowboy. I love the way the voices of the main singers intertwine, it's really just a shame that this song isn't longer. It gives similar vibes to [Divorce](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0YMVzWF9HWGbV4DZHfCyKo?si=Eo4u5WoAR8u_WpVKoAZCsg) (who I have also been really enjoying). I look forward to more songs they put out!
