I will list my (very uninformed) opinions on current media I am currently interacting with (Last updated 13/04/25).

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [Domain Theory: An Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05858)
- A lot of my friends dissertations

The books I am currently reading include:

> Around the World in 80 Games - Marcus du Sautoy

Although I haven't read much of this book, the section I have read has been captivating and interesting.

> An Introduction to Cybercultures - David Bell

I have been really enjoying what I have read of this book so far. I think partially because it is very of its time (one which I was not yet even alive for), but also because it dives in depth into different section of computing and how people interact with cyberspace. Look forward to a review on this one because it really promises to be interesting!

### Song of the Week

> To see the archive of previous weeks, see here: [Archive](/media/song-archive)

This week has been a bit strange, losing the structure of lectures and travelling around has made it feel like a mish mash of time. So getting to today and realising I had to pick a song of the week was a little bit of a jumpscare. Therefore just like this week has felt, I've put together a mish mash of random songs (most of these have come to me just today).

Earlier in the week I went to see Black Country, New Road live. They've been a band that I've been interested in for a long time, initially for their darker post punk noise with lead singer Isaac Wood and now for their much more optimistic sound without him. I think the vibe has very much stayed the same, but with the more open playing field they can experiment with their wide range of instruments (I mean a *wide* range - they have drums, piano, saxophone, guitar, bass, flute and recorder to name a few). This experimentation really pays off in their new album "Forever Howlong", which has a lot of the same feel to their Live album at Bush Hall, but has been developed into a more rounded and interesting sound. In particular I recommend [Happy Birthday](https://open.spotify.com/track/56Vk4WrIrTr3Jg7hReNZVb?si=2fb19dcee5c34b21) and [Nancy Takes the Night](https://open.spotify.com/track/3vtceW4EYrv3enjfz7MTff?si=a7471c6b80ee4915).

Now for a more random one - Geordie Greep. I don't remember exactly how he came up in conversation, but relistening to his debut album it's actually much more interesting than I originally gave it time for at release. The debut single [Holy Holy](https://open.spotify.com/track/4AiTTqrljm1r8zKr68cxPk?si=68a9e78ce83c4a32) from the album is a catchy, funky tune and the [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/A4EU_0vFzuU?si=teZ3yQUvFHuNKEre) is kinda funny - it's just Greep in a bowling alley. The most interesting sound from this is the samba vibes in some of the songs, one which is very different from previous work with black midi.

Ok this is a short one, but I wanted to share just how much I love Remi Wolf's [tiny desk](https://youtu.be/X_myO7_7KKk?si=EJ1QQJT6K8vabsYJ), especially the bossa nova cover of "Sexy Villain". I generally prefer recorded versions of songs, but the laid back soft vibe really fits Remi's songs and makes for a great tiny desk.

The last artist I want to talk about today, and the one the song of the week comes from, is Lucia and The Best Boys. Oh man gothic pop the genre you are. I originally discovered Lucia and the Best Boys through their song "Summertime". It's a nice light pop feeling song and I quite enjoyed it, but boy did I not know what I was in for. Some of Lucia and the Best Boys highlights include [Blueheart](https://open.spotify.com/track/2tYefVtZYM82eB4pdFtxmR?si=51337cda1c584c90) and [When You Dress Up](https://open.spotify.com/track/1dy0yjSUuYOqirPLWm2sXy?si=e1e9432f5c7244e2).

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:
- Dungeon Meshi (or Delicious in Dungeon)
- Wheel of Time

I really want to rewatch the original matrix trilogy, but due to the period of 'exam season' existing I have as of yet failed to watch more than 10 minutes of the first film.
