I will list my (very uninformed) opinions on current media I am currently interacting with (Last updated 60/04/25).

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [What is algebraic about algebraic effects and handlers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05923)
- [Probability monads with submonads of deterministic states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07003)
- [Domain Theory: An Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05858)

The books I am currently reading include:

> Around the World in 80 Games - Marcus du Sautoy

Although I haven't read much of this book, the section I have read has been captivating and interesting.

> Category Theory - Steve Awodey

A textbook on basics of Category Theory, one which is supposedly an easier read than "Category Theory for the Working Mathematician" by Saunders Mac Lane. While I agree with this, it really doesn't say much considering Mac Lane is notoriously hard to read (I have only really been able to understand the content post understanding the concepts from elsewhere). I think this book while good in places (particularly in the exponentials chapter) also focuses on concepts that can be confusing far too early (e.g. freely generated categories from graphs) and misses interesting contents that could be covered earlier, such as natural transformations. Overall I am enjoying it so far and it has become my primary source of learning for Category Theory, with supplements from elsewhere when the text gets too confusing.

### Song of the Week

> To see the archive of previous weeks, see here: [Archive](/media/song-archive)

On Saturday I has a 3 hour coach journey, so I planned ahead on something fun to do. I settled on picking a theme for my song of the week and trying to make a playlist that fit to this, then choosing my favourite to become the song of the week. The theme I chose was "Long songs", one which was very heavily inspired (read: stolen) from my wonderful friend [Sof](https://deltzabar.github.io/) (see their playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6DhX6VblGRJbne6GlyUAI5?si=ee97acb650704e28))! As an arbitrary rule set I let myself pick songs that were 8 minutes or longer (and hey who was I to judge if a few that were close enough got through).

I think the reason I never really pick a theme for these is because whenever someone asks me to pick something related to a theme every example just conveniently decides to take that time to leave my brain. This combined with the fact that the spotify mobile app refused to show me song lengths without me first playing them, seemed like a bit of an issue. In all reality it led to a nice session of me catching up on old songs that I forgot about, mainly that of W.H.Lung and Squid. I will not go through all the choices (because otherwise I would be writing for hours), but to pick some highlights out:

- Amber Waves: I mean it's Ethel Cain what do you expect from me (perverts ftw)
- The Wrong Side of History: I really loved regressive left for their beautiful synths and dancy music. They were a really unashamedly political band and one which I really respected for it. I love the different phases of this song, which are linked well together and keep it interesting enough to justify it's length. Luckily the main singer has gone on to create a new band "The Itch", who have released one song so far [Ursula](https://open.spotify.com/track/1M3MkQsyHneKRo2LRlBrg3?si=705eb63e207447b8) which I instantly fell in love with.
- Crap Art: I've really built myself a reputation of liking songs where you just get talked at and The Cool Greenhouse are really not helping me in this department. They definitely take some getting used to, at one point in time their single "Alexa" was the only song by them I found palatable. However over time I likened to their style of weird stories and tales spoken to a backing track of strange guitars and synth. This is their longest song and will definitely be a strange listen for most people, but I do recommend trying some of their more accessible songs such as [4Chan](https://open.spotify.com/track/5phlevcSVhsgout10jCQid?si=734db8ced70f459d) and [Landlords](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Ca2bHmcxlhzE3an2DBncY?si=c29593eab62c4995).
- The Cleaner: The first time I was introduced to Squid, via their song Houseplants, I found it funny that they were singing in such a strange way (perhaps a side effect of the fact that the drummer is singing). I don't know that I really enjoyed the song at the time, but I've certainly warmed well up to their post-punk sound now. The cleaner is one of their older songs and has a dance-esque vibe, the guitars are fun and light, the drums constant and interesting. I think one of the main (albeit stupid) reasons I like the song so much is because it reminds me of the Greg Davies BBC TV series 'The Cleaner', where Greg plays the role of a crime scene cleaner who gets into lots of silly mishaps.

The song of the week, comes from a small band local to me - NOT SOUP. I saw them not too long ago supporting Keg and not knowing what to expect I waited in anticipation for them to start. What I did not expect was a prog rock, math rock mix. Not something I usually go to see live, I was a little nervous, but boy did they show me up. The intricate and impressive guitar and poly rhythms ran over their long and impressive songs. The lyrics were interesting and sung well with great emphasis, I also thought the topics covered were interesting. The song I chose was one I felt is particularly pertinent and one which has some great lyrics.

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:
- Severance
- Dungeon Meshi (or Delicious in Dungeon)

### My Rant About "Prime Target"

What I have not been enjoying is "Prime Target", after a recent [toot](https://mathstodon.xyz/@bradheintz/113964404406035722) I saw, complaining that it mentioned prime every few seconds and calling it bad I thought how bad could it really be? Bad, really bad. As someone studying Mathematics at university, admittedly in quite a funny way. The first section of the show went fairly well, it sets the scene fairly well, with the mystery of what the main character(Edward Brooks) is working on. We understand he is one of those 'savant' type characters, one who is supposed to make the watcher assume what he says to be true and is quirky because every genius is this apparently? I think this illusion falls flat from my point of view as we get further into the show, namely the moment where Edward poses a question to the 'good' and 'bad' supervisors (as I shall put it).
    
He talks about the interesting property of a certain number, which turns out to be the sum of three consecutive squares (or something like this I can't really be bothered to go back and watch the episode). The 'good' supervisor instantly solves this, where the 'bad' says this is a silly game, before completing the puzzle at the end of the scene. Irregardless of the fact that very few mathematicians would just know this fact instantly, this felt very much like a silly cliche in that the bad person has some hints of being 'cool' in the respective subject of interest.

Watching further into the episode, we discover what is supposed to be a prime number generating formula in an ancient temple. We see the typical mad scrawling from Edward that is supposed the give the audience the idea that something magical is happening, quickly cut off with Edward running off to figure it out (I guess, he just says "I need to go"). Half of these notes are left with the 'bad' supervisor who apparently recognises this instantly as a prime number generating formula and starts working it out in his office the next day. We see a mystery observer take photos of this from a spy camera, which results in the supervisor being threatened for doing algebra. This eventually leads to the burning of all notes related to the prime number formula and the supervisor killing himself. Admittedly this does give quite an intriguing mystery about why such a group is banning research into a specific area and leads to somewhat of a cliffhanger to the first episode.

In the second episode we discover about a previous supervisee called Safiya who was also researching primes. Edward goes to the library to look into this more and when he searches for literature on primes in the most tv-centric way possible the total of four (yes four!) books on prime pop up along with a neat animation explaining that they are no longer available. I could help but laugh at this because it was so ridiculous.

Later into the episode we discover that the FBI is watching researchers in mathematics across different universities because they might discover something dangerous. One particular point that they bring up here is that "all you need to break into a computer is the right numbers", a concept that while I grasp what they were going for makes little sense in reality. At this point I basically zoned out of the second episode, one of the agents watching the researchers realises that the footage of the 'bad' supervisor killing himself is tampered with and the episode ends by the boss of this agent being shot (by mistake) for questioning this. It was at this point that I decided to stop because quite frankly I didn't see anything too interesting happening past this point. The one thing I did want to know was whether the sought after prime formula was shown on screen (and also how they justify that this just breaks security of _every_ computer, which is an insane thing to say, like at least try and talk about actual cryptography please...).
