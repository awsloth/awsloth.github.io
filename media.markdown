Here are my opinions on some current media I am currently consuming!

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [A taste of linear logic](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/lineartaste/lineartaste-revised.pdf)

The books I am currently reading include:

> The Jungle - Upton Sinclair

I am re-reading this classic so I can write a review. I think it covers an interesting and important range of topics and I hope to get much out of it than last time I read it. Particularly because I am trying to improve my sense of important themes and ideas from books, a skill I have wanted to have for a while.

> An Introduction to Cybercultures - David Bell

Of what I have read so far Cybercultures covers a good deal of interesting topics. I think the language at times can be difficult to parse because of the academic nature of the text, but I have enjoyed the extra reading and the discussions on various ideas. These include how cyberspace will change communities and how it affects our daily lives. A section I haven't got to yet, but one I am excited for is that of identity.

I think this book offers a particularly interesting view because it is from 2000 and so where predictions occur it is interesting to see how accurate they are. It is also interesting to see how certain topics stay very much the same albeit with different context.

### Song of the Week

> To see the archive of previous weeks, see here: [Archive](/media/song-archive)

As we have now surpassed halfway through the year (and kinda horrifyingly closer to the end of 2050 than the start of 2000), I figured it would be nice to look at some of the albums, eps and singles I've enjoyed that have come out so far this year. We'll take a look through the year in chronological order, a sort of recap so far if you will.

See the playlist of the songs here:

8th January

Perverts - Ethel Cain

You might be thinking "No surprise here, Anna loves Ethel Cain!" and to that I would say, "Well, of course...". But I don't think this ep is so cut and dry as you might think. To start with, it's not Ethel's usual style, it's very much an experimental ep, featuring a lot of drone music and much less of her voice. It's weird, *really weird* and while I didn't hit it off right away I now really enjoy the ambient sounds of the whole EP. I've chosen Amber Waves off this EP, perhaps because it feels on the way to Ethel's normal stuff, but maybe more because of the space it gives you. Just sit back on a bed in the dark, let it wash over you and maybe you'll feel what makes this song special to me.

7th February

Cowards - Squid

I remember listening to this album a little at the time it came out, particularly Cro-Magnon Man, with it's weird winy guitar (?) and strange sound overall. But on a relisten I actually really enjoyed the title track Cowards. The slow pace of the song as a whole in a sort of contemplative tone, accompanied by the trumpet, feels so satisfying to listen to.

7th March

Drive to Goldenhammer - Divorce

I love Divorce (yes, that one too)! No but seriously, I love their sound. It's warm it's cozy and just feels so homely to me. I love that they have two main singers, who quite often duet on songs and fit together very well. The song I chose was Jet Show, one that I think is very fun and whose lyrics are great to sing along to. The swing between each singer in different sections, with them joining up in-between is interesting.

13th March

The Giver - Chappel Roan

This song very much comes courtesy of Sof without who I wouldn't have listened to this as much as I have. Don't get me wrong, I like Chappel Roan as much as the next person, but sadly a lot of other people I talked to didn't seem to like this single loads. Well I say they can go to hell, because this is 3:23 of good ole country fun and to make it even better it's all about lesbianism :). Just listening to it now makes me want to go and do a hoedown and I would in my room if I had enough space (and knew the moves).

28th March

Forever is a Feeling - Lucy Dacus

I've listened to a little Lucy Dacus, but this is probably where I've spent most of my time listening to her stuff. It's a really vulnerable and touching album about loving and being very open about it. I think a lot of the songs are quite simple in lyrics, but that's perhaps what makes them feel so open. I chose Best Guess from this album not for any reason other than I find it really catchy in the chorus and I find it fun because of this. It's also a very soft song about loving someone for who they are and I really appreciate this.

4th April

Forever Howlong - Black Country, New Road

When this album initially came out I didn't listen to it loads. I think a lot of Black Country, New Road albums almost feel intimidating to listen to, they're quirky and different and potentially not enjoyable on the first listen. But I had tickets to see them with a few friends in my hometown, so along I went pretty fresh on their new material and excited to hear some of the songs for the first time live. The whole experience was great, helped by just how simply amazing the album is to listen to, safe to say I had broken through the barrier and this has become probably my favourite album of the year so far. It's been on repeat a lot of the time and is often a go to when I just don't know what to listen to. My favourite song off the album has to be Goodbye (Don't Tell Me), perhaps I'm feeling very retrospective right now but I just love the sort of reflective vibe it has. It's such a good round off to the album as a whole and I couldn't ask for more.

23rd April

Next to Die - Ugly (UK)

I love love love that Uglys first EP, it's so creative and playful throughout. So when I heard Ugly were making new stuff I was quietly nervous. How would they follow up such a masterpiece. To be honest when I first heard this song I though it was a bit meh, I don't know why but then I listened to it again, and again... and again. It's a new sort of sound but it brings over the elements that worked so well for them before; the layering, the simple guitar guiding along and the playful vibe that makes it feels so much like frolicking in a field.

7th May

Take A Sexy Picture Of Me - CMAT

I've listened to a small spattering of CMAT for a while, mainly her song [I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby!](https://open.spotify.com/track/7uFejCG9QDaxbmDv66Qoew?si=9e6882b16ae740c5) which I love. But when I was visiting a friend she played this song and I really enjoyed it, recognising CMATs voice too, which was nice. She's got pretty big too, watching her Glastonbury set she was really rocking the stage, this song in particular going down a treat. In particular the fact it was so much about CMAT giving a big fuck you to people who decided it was a great idea to body shame her after her last showing at the festival, with her fully leaning into body positivity. It does help that the song is also an absolute banger too, my favourite lyrics being her listing the different poses and outfits she does, it's all very The Giver-esque!

27th May

CPR - Wet Leg

Ok, back to Anna typical fashion. Growling guitar, constant drums and talky lyrics, what more could I ask for. I think the attention to detail on the sound effects is very fun, the sirens as it's own sound, the claps, voice distortion on the phone call. It's just all so catchy to listen to.

4th June

Nettles - Ethel Cain

I feel I don't really need to give much of an explanation here, if you want to see why look [here](/media/song-archive/25/06/09).

10th July

Saoirse - Maruja

What a song to round it all off on. Maruja are a really fun band to me, they have this jazz sort of vibe, but they really lean into a darker more punky vibe. I find this really interesting and fun to listen to, but this song leans into a much softer side. For a start it has some of the only proper singing I've heard from the vocalist and it's really beautiful. Whilst the lyrics are really simple and repetitive, there's a lot of emotion behind it and makes me feel a lot, especially when I just sit there and absorb the song not thinking too much and just feeling.

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:

- Gilmore Girls
- Dungeon Meshi
- Heartbreak High (particularly enjoying the autism representation)

I would like to get round to re watching the Matrix trilogy (but not the new one - that's bad).

I recently also watched (in a movie marathon) all of the star wars episodes from 1-9. I will now give my ranking of these films (with a little comment for each), I hope you enjoy :)

1. A New Hope: A classic and well written film, good fun!
2. Return of the Jedi: The film is well written, interesting and cool to watch. Bonus points for ewoks, I love those guys.
3. The Phantom Menace: I have a lot of nostalgia from playing the lego star wars podracing which means I'm a bit biased, but also this is a great film anyway (if you just ignore jar jar binks existing and the stupid "there's always a bigger fish line" what were they on about)
4. The Empire Strikes Back: I do not like that the problem the whole time was just the millennium falcon breaking, stupid and annoying, I don't like Han.
5. The Clone Wars: C3PO getting turned into a robot was pretty fun
6. Revenge of the Sith: Noo, nooo, NOOOOO! You shall die (this did not justify why Anakin switched to the dark side at all, he just kinda went yup I guess I'll do that)
7. The Force Awakens: I thought the little attempt at looking at how stormtroopers were actually people was interesting until that dialogue abruptly just stopped.
8. The Last Jedi: Felt like a rehash of the empire strikes back but much worse (why did Leia just fly through space what the hellll)
9. The Rise of Skywalker: We watched this film at 1.5x speed to make it in any way watchable

I also recently watched The Accountant 2... I think we all know how that went based off of the less than great autism representation in the first film.
