<p>The song of the week this week comes from a band called “Mandrake
Handshake”. I discovered this band about 3 years ago now (funnily enough
from a <a

I bought from their label at the time) and have loved their groovy,
psychedelic noise ever since. They are formed of 10 (yes ten) members
which is honestly crazy to me, I do not know how they fit on any
stages.</p>
<p>Just last Friday they released their 50 minute debut album <a

Worlds</a>, which I cannot recommend enough, and is where the track of
the week comes from. Also last Friday came Sam Fender’s third studio
album <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6Abecbed8BYAdHy9RaVoY7?si=mHSqnUxqT8uHrOoNvxqVNg">People
Watching</a>, also a great album and one which made it difficult to pick
my favourite song this week. I particularly like <a

Lie</a>, but felt that it did not best the track I have selected. See
you next week, where I look forward to hearing Sports Team’s new album
“Boys these Days” (the single <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6SZiBRJYG3rd3yiU4PDsxZ?si=45a24f6883fa4e73">Bang
Bang Bang</a> is simply amazing), I particularly look forward to the
track “Maybe When We’re Thirty” which was incredibly to hear live in a
hometown venue back in November.</p>
