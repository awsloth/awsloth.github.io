<p>With three exams coming up this week (and one I am particularly
stressed for) I have very little energy and time to write my song of the
week. For this reason I am going to just give a list of a few songs I
have been enjoying recently and a couple thoughts for each one.</p>
<p>Madness - I have always had a love for the ska sounds of Madness,
probably inherited from my dad and the long road trips my family took to
Scotland, where the “Complete Madness” album was often played. I have a
sort of nostalgia for these songs for this reason, but in their own
right they are just so fun and playful.</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4f9gzn6DWKmJ1G9e4zSxDB?si=793a6797d09341af">Night
Boat to Cairo</a>: Whether I have a soft spot for this song because it
features on Just Dance 2 I will not comment on. This aside, I will
always appreciate the willing to commit to a theming for their songs,
adding in great sound effects and linking lyrics.</li>
<li><a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7JIr53FZOBcTjZFn5ddJmJ?si=248e4603f0c14179">House
of Fun</a>: This song very much lives up to its name, it feels very
bouncy and silly. I can’t help but bob along to it when I listen.</li>
<li><a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1q51O9YNvjjLd9FtlPakwI?si=f09d1c226005434e">In
the City</a>: Ok did I mainly choose this song because of the “Oooba
dooba dooba dooba”? Yes. Do I have anything else to say? No.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bon Iver - I picked up a liking for Bon Iver way back when I was
dancing with Phoenix Dance theatre and we were doing some warm ups to “I
Need A Forest Fire” by James Blake and Bon Iver. I think it’s such an
interesting piece of music and really beautiful, I really enjoyed
dancing to it at the time (and would love to now). Admittedly I do
generally listen to Bon Iver when miserable because it feels very light
and non-committal - but I’m sure there are other ways of listening to it
(that I haven’t discovered).</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0bhBtXHQX3u6dSAPF59qGx?si=1b560d59aced4042">Flume</a>:
I listened to this song a <em>lot</em> during the second lockdown, most
of what I remember from this song is long walks in winter snow feeling
quite miserable. So I don’t exactly feel great recommending this to
others, but it holds a lot of meaning to me and I think that’s
important. I think it does sort of hug you, or maybe envelope you, not
in a warm embrace but a comforting one.</li>
<li><a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/16WkFbQRW2BhvMUwuIaIsx?si=96b48583723b4d36">8
(circle)</a>: I think I will always remember this album being associated
to James Acaster, he has a whole thing about how 2016 was the best year
for music and to be fair this album is great. I think this track has a
much more optimistic feel to it. Fun fact: this is my third most
streamed song of all time both in terms of listen time and individual
plays.</li>
<li><a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4nOHprlBR2OHWZe1EGrxdr?si=2e710a4ed9a94355">RABi</a>:
The third track in the spectrum of optimism and the one that feels the
most optimistic. This song is much more loose and free feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The song of the week comes from Bon Iver, but actually the remix of
“I think about it all the time” from the brat remix album (which I am
sure fellow webring pal <a href="https://charliew.net">Charlie</a> will
appreciate). I think the coming together of two different genres here
works so so perfectly and the song itself doesn’t only sound great, but
also explores meaningful topics.</p>
