            <p>I was working up this week to write a long post, which will now have
            to wait til next week as it has become more work than I expected and I
            want to do it justice. Therefore this week I will talk about a couple
            new songs that have been released recently that I’ve been enjoying (only
            2 because I’ve left this quite late).</p>
            <p>The first time I saw Big Special was when they were supporting
            Deadletter and they were so incredibly different from anything I had
            seen before. It is very much spoken word, and even more so when live.
            Joe (the ‘singer’) stands with his mic loose in his hand and steps back
            and forth in a rocking motion, bellowing each word down the mic - you
            can tell he means every word. Meanwhile Callum (the drummer) sits at the
            back smashing the drum set to the words and a backing track accompanies
            them, but it just fills the blank space and doesn’t take away from the
            pair’s performance. It all culminates in an astounding sight and sound,
            one which is addictive and very encapsulating. Somewhat soon after this
            they released their first album, “Post Industrial Hometown Blues”, which
            I really enjoyed. I think the songs themselves hold up well, but it’s
            the lyrics that are so fun to explore and speak along to. They are
            enunciated with such power, almost as if performed as part of slam
            poetry.</p>
            <p>After this success I forgot about Big Special for a while until just
            the other day I stumbled upon a music video for <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3QrvKxTmQWIpI9cGE3HakK?si=38aa5db3b7e44f8a">God
            Save The Pony</a>, from their new album “National Average”. This came as
            a bit of a surprise to me as I had no idea they were releasing new stuff
            let alone a whole new album. I think this song takes a fun new
            direction, whilst keeping the key features that make them so good; the
            strong drums, the lyrics and the pronunciation. What I enjoy from the
            new additions is the distortion on vocals and the ever catchy bass and
            relentless staccato of the synth.</p>
            <p>Last week I watched the Sprints set from Glastonbury and really
            enjoyed the new song they teased “Descartes”. Unfortunately I got
            distracted by the cover of “Foundations” they played with Kate Nash that
            they clearly hadn’t practised and so was quite cringe to watch. However,
            they released the track earlier this week and I have been enjoying it a
            lot since. It’s got a lot of the classic Sprints sound to it, the fast
            guitar over the top, the noisy distorted guitar supporting and heavy
            drums in the back. I have been a bit annoyed with some of Sprint’s stuff
            because it does feel all a bit similar but I feel they have branched out
            here more and it’s a fun track (especially after having a bit of a
            stressful meeting).</p>
