<h2 id="section">13/04/25</h2>
<p>This week has been a bit strange, losing the structure of lectures
and travelling around has made it feel like a mish mash of time. So
getting to today and realising I had to pick a song of the week was a
little bit of a jumpscare. Therefore just like this week has felt, I’ve
put together a mish mash of random songs (most of these have come to me
just today).</p>
<p>Earlier in the week I went to see Black Country, New Road live.
They’ve been a band that I’ve been interested in for a long time,
initially for their darker post punk noise with lead singer Isaac Wood
and now for their much more optimistic sound without him. I think the
vibe has very much stayed the same, but with the more open playing field
they can experiment with their wide range of instruments (I mean a
<em>wide</em> range - they have drums, piano, saxophone, guitar, bass,
flute and recorder to name a few). This experimentation really pays off
in their new album “Forever Howlong”, which has a lot of the same feel
to their Live album at Bush Hall, but has been developed into a more
rounded and interesting sound. In particular I recommend <a

Birthday</a> and <a

Takes the Night</a>.</p>
<p>Now for a more random one - Geordie Greep. I don’t remember exactly
how he came up in conversation, but relistening to his debut album it’s
actually much more interesting than I originally gave it time for at
release. The debut single <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4AiTTqrljm1r8zKr68cxPk?si=68a9e78ce83c4a32">Holy
Holy</a> from the album is a catchy, funky tune and the <a
href="https://youtu.be/A4EU_0vFzuU?si=teZ3yQUvFHuNKEre">accompanying
video</a> is kinda funny - it’s just Greep in a bowling alley. The most
interesting sound from this is the samba vibes in some of the songs, one
which is very different from previous work with black midi.</p>
<p>Ok this is a short one, but I wanted to share just how much I love
Remi Wolf’s <a
href="https://youtu.be/X_myO7_7KKk?si=EJ1QQJT6K8vabsYJ">tiny desk</a>,
especially the bossa nova cover of “Sexy Villain”. I generally prefer
recorded versions of songs, but the laid back soft vibe really fits
Remi’s songs and makes for a great tiny desk.</p>
<p>The last artist I want to talk about today, and the one the song of
the week comes from, is Lucia and The Best Boys. Oh man gothic pop the
genre you are. I originally discovered Lucia and the Best Boys through
their song “Summertime”. It’s a nice light pop feeling song and I quite
enjoyed it, but boy did I not know what I was in for. Some of Lucia and
the Best Boys highlights include <a

and <a

You Dress Up</a>.</p>
