<h2 id="section">16/03/25</h2>
<p>This week has been a bit of a throwback in terms of music. This was
mainly due to the fantastic cover of <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2w7MvUzOvRXZCjFEV7tahC?si=a4afe3c1ab994831">Head
Over Heels</a> by She’s in Parties. They have put their lovely ethereal
touch on the song, with synths over the original piano. I really love
the touch of the lead singers voice - it feels much less talk-y than the
original and the song feels overall more smooth.</p>
<p>This song caused me to remember a cover of <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0cvW31FIK6B3mUqWLUHorv?si=0e3864cf7d784b54">Careless
Whisper</a> by Chicago band Brigitte Calls Me Baby. The band themselves
feel really nostalgic of the 80s vibes and I cannot recommend their self
written songs. I originally discovered them on YouTube through a
recording of one of their shows in Minneapolis and it is just incredible
(see: <a
href="https://youtu.be/H_OC1Po62Rs?si=XU4pjvf7Y6QemMks">here</a>). The
singer has such a smooth voice and one that really fits the retro theme
of their music.</p>
<p>Before we get to the song of the week, I figured I would mention a
song that I have been loving (albeit one that doesn’t really fit the
theme that seems to have sort of shown up). This is <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/33xc1xV00ATu5B7yU6TLm1?si=592c4c7835d640fc">Photo
Day</a>, the first song in Keg’s debut album. This came quite a surprise
to me, but it was more than welcome and I have thoroughly enjoyed all
the songs on this album. I think this song stood out to me so much
because of the quiet, almost solemn, trumpet which slowly builds up with
guitars joining in slowly up and up until you are left with a sort of
fuzzy sound. This breaks through to Keg’s signature cacophony of loud
trumpet, guitar and spoken word lyrics. As usual with Keg the lyrics are
part of some strange story (see: Kids, Michael Phelps), but I think this
song has a nice mix of their classic sound and some more optimistic,
light sound, particularly with more soft trumpet mixed into the more
heavy.</p>
<p>Recently I saw that the lead singer of Soda Blonde, Faye, sang with
David Bowie’s band in an orchestra type set up and one of the songs she
sang was “Five Years”, the smallest snippet of this reminded me of just
how great and album this came from. I cannot fault a single song in the
nearly 40 minutes playtime and why should I? The album is considered a
classic and it really has stood the test of time. From “Starman” to
“Ziggy Stardust” and “Moonage Daydream” the songs just hit every time.
For this week I chose the song that reminded me of the album “Five
Years”. I really love the storytelling over the whole album and this
song sets the scene so well. Earth has used up all of its resources and
will be destroyed in five years (feels somewhat relevant eh?). It’s
quite a melancholy song, but it’s dramatic and actually quite beautiful
in of itself.</p>
