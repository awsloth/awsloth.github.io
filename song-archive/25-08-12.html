            <p>If you know me well enough you know that I am completely normal about
            Ethel Cain, by which I really mean I am totally obsessed with her and
            really enjoy her music. So when her new album released last Friday I was
            completely absorbed and to be honest still am. In fact as of writing I
            have listened to the album 20 times, totaling nearly 30 hours of
            listening to just songs off the album. So, yes, obsessed is a little bit
            of an understatement. With that said, I wanted to explore the individual
            songs on what I think is a truly amazing and interesting album.</p>
            <h4 id="janie">Janie</h4>
            <p>We start with a very simple guitar, slow and thoughtful, that really
            sets the tone for the new album. Ethel’s voice comes in, full of emotion
            and lyrics to match it, particularly “please leave open your most quiet
            door”. This whole song feels very typical of Ethel’s style and is a
            really nice introduction to the album which settles you in for the long
            ride.</p>
            <h4 id="willoughbys-theme">Willoughby’s Theme</h4>
            <p>Janie fades out and in comes a song which is one of my favourites on
            the album. It feels very much like we get to play with elements from
            Perverts (Ethel’s previous EP), which felt like a standalone, but seems
            to have (very happily) found it’s way in here. We start with this very
            empty space filled only by piano all alone and very raw - you can hear
            the notes carry as they are played, something that reminds me of a piano
            I used to play at a relative’s - it’s very vulnerable but playful. Then
            out of the darkness creeps this rolling and rippling, growling guitar
            which plays together with the piano. They’re such different textures but
            they mix together in this beautiful and interesting way. The piano
            becomes this quick repeated set of two notes along with the simple
            melody from the start. It’s a really fun and interesting song, as Hayden
            says “I wanted to try and sonically capture the nauseating, dizzying
            fear and rush of falling in love” and I really believe you can tell it’s
            in here.</p>
            <h4 id="fuck-me-eyes">Fuck Me Eyes</h4>
            <p>As I’ve said before, this really feels like the ‘American Teenager’
            of this album. It’s very much the only pop-like song on the album, but
            it’s a fun one and I like it. The lyrics are clear to hear and
            interesting to follow. I like the drums, the vocals and the sort of
            flashing synths - flashing in the sense that sparkling lights flash up
            on a christmas tree.</p>
            <h4 id="nettles">Nettles</h4>
            <p>If you don’t already know how I feel about this one read <a
            href="/media/song-archive/25/06/09">my review</a>!</p>
            <h4 id="willoughbys-interlude">Willoughby’s Interlude</h4>
            <p>This is the first song that I thought wasn’t outstanding. Don’t get
            me wrong I do like it, but I feel like there’s not loads to go off of. I
            like to lie down and close my eyes and let this one just wash over me.
            It starts with some distorted voices, very familiar to songs like <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2SB4wRBpN4C1lssIGqKD4d?si=b7473496c25a402a">Pulldrone</a>
            in perverts, then it builds with these large sounds that echo and thrum
            over the track. Throughout the track these dissonant sounds become more
            clear and harmonise out, before settling down towards the end.</p>
            <h4 id="dust-bowl">Dust Bowl</h4>
            <p>Going off the listens on spotify this track has the most listens
            outside of the singles, which is really interesting to me, because it is
            certainly not my favourite. My suspicion is that these listens has come
            from spotify adding just this track to release playlists. This is an
            interesting choice to me, I suppose out of the non single tracks it’s
            probably the most widely “acceptable”, though I agree with Sof’s review
            that Janie would be a better choice here (or at least one that I enjoy
            more).</p>
            <h4 id="a-knock-at-the-door">A Knock At The Door</h4>
            <p>I really enjoy this track, it feels really quite different from
            others on the album. You get to hear the squeaks and scratches as the
            guitar player’s hand moves up and down the strings, with the soft
            acoustic sounds it plays out. This all sang over by Ethel’s simply
            beautiful voice.</p>
            <h4 id="radio-towers">Radio Towers</h4>
            <p>This is my favourite track on the album. Which feels weird to say,
            there’s no singing and really the song itself is not that complex, but
            I’m just so endlessly enamoured by it. I get drawn back in for more
            every listen I take. The constant beep in the background, the thunder,
            the screeching and whistling sounds of wind, and the simple synths all
            layered on top. The atmosphere from it is truly incredible and I can
            really imagine just being sat in the dark on a stormy night watching out
            onto an empty road. I really truly love this song.</p>
            <h4 id="tempest">Tempest</h4>
            <p>The smooth transition into this song from Radio Towers really joins
            the two together for me and I really enjoy listening to them back to
            back. The drums here feel incredible and everything else sort of echoes
            around them. The vocals are long and echoey, along with all the
            instruments which echo and distort in the background, making the whole
            thing feel sort of disorientating. The vocals however really cut through
            the instruments, especially towards the end and the slow rise and fade
            of the synths at each drum hit drag along before it all just cuts out
            completely and we are left with nothing.</p>
            <h4 id="waco-texas">Waco, Texas</h4>
            <p>The last song on the album and what a song. As Sof said “I put it on
            and somehow it seems to finish immediately”, which is truly impressive
            given that this song is 15 minutes long! I really like the plainness of
            this song, you can hear all the lyrics and the simplicity of the
            instruments throughout feels comforting in a way. The song takes it’s
            time, but it just passes through you as it goes, plodding on. Not so
            slow it is annoying, but also not so fast that you feel it is running
            away from you, the perfect pace to enjoy it as it comes through and
            really appreciate it’s beauty in full. What an ending!!</p>
