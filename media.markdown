I will list my (very uninformed) opinions on current media I am currently interacting with (Last updated 20/04/25).

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [Domain Theory: An Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05858)
- A lot of my friends dissertations

The books I am currently reading include:

> Around the World in 80 Games - Marcus du Sautoy

Although I haven't read much of this book, the section I have read has been captivating and interesting.

> An Introduction to Cybercultures - David Bell

I have been really enjoying what I have read of this book so far. I think partially because it is very of its time (one which I was not yet even alive for), but also because it dives in depth into different section of computing and how people interact with cyberspace. Look forward to a review on this one because it really promises to be interesting!

### Song of the Week

> To see the archive of previous weeks, see here: [Archive](/media/song-archive)

I don't have a lot to write this week mainly because I'm really tired. Therefore I'm gonna do a small deep-dive on a band I've been discovering lately.

The band BODEGA have always been on just the outside of my listening circle. I've heard their ever popular "Statuette on the Console", a song I'm not too bothered by, it feels quite generic and not that exciting, but it's an ok listen. For this reason I never really bothered to look into their stuff too much more, a bit of a shame, but arguably not my fault as such.

My recent discovery comes completely separate from Statuette on the Console, in the form of the song [Doers](https://open.spotify.com/track/2L0FeqfIAs0Cc6x2sLfsCh?si=7e61331a37584898). This song really got me hooked and was the song that got me to listen to more of BODEGA's stuff. I really like the bassline and the special attention to different details in the background with all the different sound effects, especially the echoing of doers (do-do-do-do-doerrrs). I think my favourite part is the 'planning part' particularly the "10 minutes - planning my next 10 minutes". It seems so silly but damn could I imagine this being a real thing.

The next song on the album, [Territorial Call of the Female](https://open.spotify.com/track/72KVDc2IbRHukPqJ9CzKTX?si=0ac07d36fec0463b), is also a great song. The bass is fun, the repeating bird call in the background is a unique and fitting choice and the repetitive lyrics with weird pronunciation I find really interesting. It really gives me a sort of oscillating feeling, the enunciation of words adding to this vibe. I'm not sure why it feels kind of familiar, but I like it.

The song of the week is purely vibes based, mainly because I just find the lyrics so satisfying. I mean if you really think about ATMs they are weird right?

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:
- Dungeon Meshi (or Delicious in Dungeon)
- Wheel of Time

I really want to rewatch the original matrix trilogy, but due to the period of 'exam season' existing I have as of yet failed to watch more than 10 minutes of the first film.
