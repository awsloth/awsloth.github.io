Before you start reading, you better get in a good catching position because I'm about to hurl 5 songs at you real quick and then leave (sorry got one last exam to be revising for).

> [Sour](https://open.spotify.com/track/2n9xQU5X6ftBfSuElHfxC6?si=23c736231bf84545) - Witch Fever <- Song of the Week!

I recently discovered Witch Fever, through Bad Waitress - a band whose album [No Taste](https://open.spotify.com/album/45ekLgDqo4L7p5Q79tpQOV?si=PmhXx5hfS52e7GKnOvSmSw) I have a particular fondness for. Witch Fever feel like Bad Waitress, but taken up a notch and more consistently heavy. As my friend Sof said they are like Lambrini Girls, but less punk and more metal.

> [Criminal](https://open.spotify.com/track/6PNvv1dmDbOWrAYwEcuKBX?si=f538f79d977748fd) - Fiona Apple

This song was recommended to me (in a way) by my friend Jess. When I first listened to this song I just couldn't stop, it feels so smooth and jazzy. I could imagine such a entertaining and fun dance to fit along to this.

> [Transgender Dysphoria Blues](https://open.spotify.com/track/4b1Y41U44kP7gzO7MUNGbe?si=5b97016f7e6945cb) - Against Me!

Thank you Sof I love this one <3

I sat and listened to this one before one of the exams I have been most stressed for ever. It means so so much to me.

> [Bloom Baby Bloom](https://open.spotify.com/track/3QJtQCtKVX5rLNYEsy4CWA?si=0546a6c4adbf4617) - Wolf Alice

New Wolf Alice! - I like this they feel proper rocky and while I like their toned down songs, this is a fun direction and I await gleefully for their new stuff.

> [Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach](https://open.spotify.com/track/46WOptLnXUtH3LOyYvmMO1?si=e3f41b75d0a74374) - Gorillaz

I love the way Gorillaz can blend genres, sometimes it works (see: this song), sometimes it doesn't (see: The Pink Phantom, what were they thinking???). Snoop dog and a brass ensemble? Fuck yes give me more please.
