<p>If you know me well enough you know that I am completely normal about
Ethel Cain, by which I really mean I am totally obsessed with her and
really enjoy her music. So when her new album released last Friday I was
completely absorbed and to be honest still am. In fact as of writing I
have listened to the album 20 times, totaling nearly 30 hours of
listening to just songs off the album. So, yes, obsessed is a little bit
of an understatement. With that said, I wanted to explore the individual
songs on what I think is a truly amazing and interesting album.</p>
<h4 id="janie">Janie</h4>
<p>We start with a very simple guitar, slow and thoughtful, that really
sets the tone for the new album. Ethel’s voice comes in, full of emotion
and lyrics to match it, particularly “please leave open your most quiet
door”. This whole song feels very typical of Ethel’s style and is a
really nice introduction to the album which settles you in for the long
ride.</p>
<h4 id="willoughbys-theme">Willoughby’s Theme</h4>
<p>Janie fades out and in comes a song which is one of my favourites on
the album. It feels very much like we get to play with elements from
Perverts (Ethel’s previous EP), which felt like a standalone, but seems
to have (very happily) found it’s way in here. We start with this very
empty space filled only by piano all alone and very raw - you can hear
the notes carry as they are played, something that reminds me of a piano
I used to play at a relative’s - it’s very vulnerable but playful. Then
out of the darkness creeps this rolling and rippling, growling guitar
which plays together with the piano. They’re such different textures but
they mix together in this beautiful and interesting way. The piano
becomes this quick repeated set of two notes along with the simple
melody from the start. It’s a really fun and interesting song, as Hayden
says “I wanted to try and sonically capture the nauseating, dizzying
fear and rush of falling in love” and I really believe you can tell it’s
in here.</p>
<h4 id="fuck-me-eyes">Fuck Me Eyes</h4>
<p>As I’ve said before, this really feels like the ‘American Teenager’
of this album. It’s very much the only pop-like song on the album, but
it’s a fun one and I like it. The lyrics are clear to hear and
interesting to follow. I like the drums, the vocals and the sort of
flashing synths - flashing in the sense that sparkling lights flash up
on a christmas tree.</p>
<h4 id="nettles">Nettles</h4>
<p>If you don’t already know how I feel about this one read <a
href="/media/song-archive/25/06/09">my review</a>!</p>
<h4 id="willoughbys-interlude">Willoughby’s Interlude</h4>
<p>This is the first song that I thought wasn’t outstanding. Don’t get
me wrong I do like it, but I feel like there’s not loads to go off of. I
like to lie down and close my eyes and let this one just wash over me.
It starts with some distorted voices, very familiar to songs like <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2SB4wRBpN4C1lssIGqKD4d?si=b7473496c25a402a">Pulldrone</a>
in perverts, then it builds with these large sounds that echo and thrum
over the track. Throughout the track these dissonant sounds become more
clear and harmonise out, before settling down towards the end.</p>
<h4 id="dust-bowl">Dust Bowl</h4>
<p>Going off the listens on spotify this track has the most listens
outside of the singles, which is really interesting to me, because it is
certainly not my favourite. My suspicion is that these listens has come
from spotify adding just this track to release playlists. This is an
interesting choice to me, I suppose out of the non single tracks it’s
probably the most widely “acceptable”, though I agree with Sof’s review
that Janie would be a better choice here (or at least one that I enjoy
more).</p>
<h4 id="a-knock-at-the-door">A Knock At The Door</h4>
<p>I really enjoy this track, it feels really quite different from
others on the album. You get to hear the squeaks and scratches as the
guitar player’s hand moves up and down the strings, with the soft
acoustic sounds it plays out. This all sang over by Ethel’s simply
beautiful voice.</p>
<h4 id="radio-towers">Radio Towers</h4>
<p>This is my favourite track on the album. Which feels weird to say,
there’s no singing and really the song itself is not that complex, but
I’m just so endlessly enamoured by it. I get drawn back in for more
every listen I take. The constant beep in the background, the thunder,
the screeching and whistling sounds of wind, and the simple synths all
layered on top. The atmosphere from it is truly incredible and I can
really imagine just being sat in the dark on a stormy night watching out
onto an empty road. I really truly love this song.</p>
<h4 id="tempest">Tempest</h4>
<p>The smooth transition into this song from Radio Towers really joins
the two together for me and I really enjoy listening to them back to
back. The drums here feel incredible and everything else sort of echoes
around them. The vocals are long and echoey, along with all the
instruments which echo and distort in the background, making the whole
thing feel sort of disorientating. The vocals however really cut through
the instruments, especially towards the end and the slow rise and fade
of the synths at each drum hit drag along before it all just cuts out
completely and we are left with nothing.</p>
<h4 id="waco-texas">Waco, Texas</h4>
<p>The last song on the album and what a song. As Sof said “I put it on
and somehow it seems to finish immediately”, which is truly impressive
given that this song is 15 minutes long! I really like the plainness of
this song, you can hear all the lyrics and the simplicity of the
instruments throughout feels comforting in a way. The song takes it’s
time, but it just passes through you as it goes, plodding on. Not so
slow it is annoying, but also not so fast that you feel it is running
away from you, the perfect pace to enjoy it as it comes through and
really appreciate it’s beauty in full. What an ending!!</p>
