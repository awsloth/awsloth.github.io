<p>As we have now surpassed halfway through the year (and kinda
horrifyingly closer to the end of 2050 than the start of 2000), I
figured it would be nice to look at some of the albums, eps and singles
I’ve enjoyed that have come out so far this year. We’ll take a look
through the year in chronological order, a sort of recap so far if you
will.</p>

<p>8th January</p>
<p>Perverts - Ethel Cain</p>
<p>You might be thinking “No surprise here, Anna loves Ethel Cain!” and
to that I would say, “Well, of course…”. But I don’t think this ep is so
cut and dry as you might think. To start with, it’s not Ethel’s usual
style, it’s very much an experimental ep, featuring a lot of drone music
and much less of her voice. It’s weird, <em>really weird</em> and while
I didn’t hit it off right away I now really enjoy the ambient sounds of
the whole EP. I’ve chosen Amber Waves off this EP, perhaps because it
feels on the way to Ethel’s normal stuff, but maybe more because of the
space it gives you. Just sit back on a bed in the dark, let it wash over
you and maybe you’ll feel what makes this song special to me.</p>
<p>7th February</p>
<p>Cowards - Squid</p>
<p>I remember listening to this album a little at the time it came out,
particularly Cro-Magnon Man, with it’s weird winy guitar (?) and strange
sound overall. But on a relisten I actually really enjoyed the title
track Cowards. The slow pace of the song as a whole in a sort of
contemplative tone, accompanied by the trumpet, feels so satisfying to
listen to.</p>
<p>7th March</p>
<p>Drive to Goldenhammer - Divorce</p>
<p>I love Divorce (yes, that one too)! No but seriously, I love their
sound. It’s warm it’s cozy and just feels so homely to me. I love that
they have two main singers, who quite often duet on songs and fit
together very well. The song I chose was Jet Show, one that I think is
very fun and whose lyrics are great to sing along to. The swing between
each singer in different sections, with them joining up in-between is
interesting.</p>
<p>13th March</p>
<p>The Giver - Chappel Roan</p>
<p>This song very much comes courtesy of Sof without who I wouldn’t have
listened to this as much as I have. Don’t get me wrong, I like Chappel
Roan as much as the next person, but sadly a lot of other people I
talked to didn’t seem to like this single loads. Well I say they can go
to hell, because this is 3:23 of good ole country fun and to make it
even better it’s all about lesbianism :). Just listening to it now makes
me want to go and do a hoedown and I would in my room if I had enough
space (and knew the moves).</p>
<p>28th March</p>
<p>Forever is a Feeling - Lucy Dacus</p>
<p>I’ve listened to a little Lucy Dacus, but this is probably where I’ve
spent most of my time listening to her stuff. It’s a really vulnerable
and touching album about loving and being very open about it. I think a
lot of the songs are quite simple in lyrics, but that’s perhaps what
makes them feel so open. I chose Best Guess from this album not for any
reason other than I find it really catchy in the chorus and I find it
fun because of this. It’s also a very soft song about loving someone for
who they are and I really appreciate this.</p>
<p>4th April</p>
<p>Forever Howlong - Black Country, New Road</p>
<p>When this album initially came out I didn’t listen to it loads. I
think a lot of Black Country, New Road albums almost feel intimidating
to listen to, they’re quirky and different and potentially not enjoyable
on the first listen. But I had tickets to see them with a few friends in
my hometown, so along I went pretty fresh on their new material and
excited to hear some of the songs for the first time live. The whole
experience was great, helped by just how simply amazing the album is to
listen to, safe to say I had broken through the barrier and this has
become probably my favourite album of the year so far. It’s been on
repeat a lot of the time and is often a go to when I just don’t know
what to listen to. My favourite song off the album has to be Goodbye
(Don’t Tell Me), perhaps I’m feeling very retrospective right now but I
just love the sort of reflective vibe it has. It’s such a good round off
to the album as a whole and I couldn’t ask for more.</p>
<p>23rd April</p>
<p>Next to Die - Ugly (UK)</p>
<p>I love love love that Uglys first EP, it’s so creative and playful
throughout. So when I heard Ugly were making new stuff I was quietly
nervous. How would they follow up such a masterpiece. To be honest when
I first heard this song I though it was a bit meh, I don’t know why but
then I listened to it again, and again… and again. It’s a new sort of
sound but it brings over the elements that worked so well for them
before; the layering, the simple guitar guiding along and the playful
vibe that makes it feels so much like frolicking in a field.</p>
<p>7th May</p>
<p>Take A Sexy Picture Of Me - CMAT</p>
<p>I’ve listened to a small spattering of CMAT for a while, mainly her
song <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7uFejCG9QDaxbmDv66Qoew?si=9e6882b16ae740c5">I
Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby!</a> which I love. But when I was visiting a
friend she played this song and I really enjoyed it, recognising CMATs
voice too, which was nice. She’s got pretty big too, watching her
Glastonbury set she was really rocking the stage, this song in
particular going down a treat. In particular the fact it was so much
about CMAT giving a big fuck you to people who decided it was a great
idea to body shame her after her last showing at the festival, with her
fully leaning into body positivity. It does help that the song is also
an absolute banger too, my favourite lyrics being her listing the
different poses and outfits she does, it’s all very The Giver-esque!</p>
<p>27th May</p>
<p>CPR - Wet Leg</p>
<p>Ok, back to Anna typical fashion. Growling guitar, constant drums and
talky lyrics, what more could I ask for. I think the attention to detail
on the sound effects is very fun, the sirens as it’s own sound, the
claps, voice distortion on the phone call. It’s just all so catchy to
listen to.</p>
<p>4th June</p>
<p>Nettles - Ethel Cain</p>
<p>I feel I don’t really need to give much of an explanation here, if
you want to see why look <a
href="/media/song-archive/25/06/09">here</a>.</p>
<p>10th July</p>
<p>Saoirse - Maruja</p>
<p>What a song to round it all off on. Maruja are a really fun band to
me, they have this jazz sort of vibe, but they really lean into a darker
more punky vibe. I find this really interesting and fun to listen to,
but this song leans into a much softer side. For a start it has some of
the only proper singing I’ve heard from the vocalist and it’s really
beautiful. Whilst the lyrics are really simple and repetitive, there’s a
lot of emotion behind it and makes me feel a lot, especially when I just
sit there and absorb the song not thinking too much and just
feeling.</p>
