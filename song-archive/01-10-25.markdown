Wow has it been a long time since I wrote one of these. I've been kinda stressed and busy with other writing (my summer research project) so I've not really felt the pull of more writing on the side. It's kinda funny that I've decided to do one now given the deadline for that is tomorrow (and I haven't finished it!), but hey the mind wants to write when it wants to write. With that said let's dive right into some songs shall we?

First up: Dry Cleaning. If you're a regular fan of my song of the week you know I like post-punk and one of the typical features here is some really talk-y vocals. Take that and turn it up to a million and then you'll have Dry Cleaning. The vocalist, Florence Shaw, would almost sounds like she was reading the lyrics from a book were it not for the different quirks in tone and spacing between lines. It's weird and strange but fun, especially combined with the often bizarre lyrics and stories told in the songs.

Perhaps my first introduction to Dry Cleaning can express to you the oddness they give off. This is the song [Goodnight](https://open.spotify.com/track/04P3v2iz7oF416UeDnvGZW?si=42373c3fff234f28), from their second EP; Sweet Princess. The lyrics are formed of youtube comments from aphex twin songs. These are so out there and zoning in and really listening to the lyrics you can only laugh sometimes.

Another favourite of mine is [Tony Speaks!](https://open.spotify.com/track/0v1E9THk87pvNNlCpDP3js?si=ccd74aae1c59470c). If you want some more recommendations from their discography let me know!

Anyway all this listening to Dry Cleaning I was doing must have done something, because they announcemed a new album and dropped a single just this week! I really recommend you listen to the new single [Hit My Head All Day](https://open.spotify.com/track/0JIKmYZmtDKqXAU37ZqwbN?si=da4ebd922885408c). I had it on repeat all of Monday and it's such an earworm.

Now for the song of the week. As I said earlier, I've been pretty stressed lately, with uni starting up again and projects creeping up again, so I've needed some different music to calm down. Mainly because I cannot listen to my normal music when I feel stressed. Somehow I stumbled across this album by Laurie Torres and wow was it just what I needed. It's a collection of instrumental tracks d with a main focus on piano, synth and drums. In particular like [Int√©rieurs](https://open.spotify.com/track/25yXIpb5rqudma0hQIHc5v?si=59324b147e7d4a78), the drums and piano mix so well together in the most fun and fluid way, but my favourite has to be the first track off of the album, Duvet, which is my song of the week. It starts slow with synth building up, this feels kinda of reminiscient to some of Ethel Cain, though with perhaps a more light tone. The piano is playful and dances on top of the delicate synth in the background. I don't know what it is about the track exactly, but it just works right now and that's what matters.
