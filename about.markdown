I am a maths and computer science student at the University of Birmingham. Current interests include Category Theory, Type Theory, Proof Assistants, and Domain Theory.

If you want to find me elsewhere I am on [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/awsloth) and also on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/njuav1quxpqzgp8tyhkfba5on).
