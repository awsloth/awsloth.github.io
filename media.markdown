I will list my (very uninformed) opinions on current media I am currently interacting with (Last updated 03/03/25).

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [What is algebraic about algebraic effects and handlers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05923)
- [Probability monads with submonads of deterministic states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07003)
- [Domain Theory: An Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05858)

The books I am currently reading include:

> Around the World in 80 Games - Marcus du Sautoy

Although I haven't read much of this book, the section I have read has been captivating and interesting.

> Category Theory - Steve Awodey

A textbook on basics of Category Theory, one which is supposedly an easier read than "Category Theory for the Working Mathematician" by Saunders Mac Lane. While I agree with this, it really doesn't say much considering Mac Lane is notoriously hard to read (I have only really been able to understand the content post understanding the concepts from elsewhere). I think this book while good in places (particularly in the exponentials chapter) also focuses on concepts that can be confusing far too early (e.g. freely generated categories from graphs) and misses interesting contents that could be covered earlier, such as natural transformations. Overall I am enjoying it so far and it has become my primary source of learning for Category Theory, with supplements from elsewhere when the text gets too confusing.

### Song of the Week

This week has been a real turning point in the weather, having consistent double digit temperatures and sunny warm days has meant I've enjoyed a lot more time outside. I think the song I have chosen really captures the sort of playful and joyous feeling I'm getting from the coming of spring. Ugly are a band I discovered back in March this year, they were supporting Bleach Lab at the Hare and Hounds, a wonderfully intimate venue and one very reminiscent of my favourite Leeds venue, the Brudenell. Having never listened to them before the night, but being vaguely aware of their existence I didn't really know what to expect. A weird mish mash of country-esque tones, soft guitar and layered vocals was not what I was expecting, nevertheless it was a hugely pleasant surprise. Their EP [Twice Around the Sun](https://open.spotify.com/album/3wzMjiyIQ2zDv3suwSHxpp?si=i2MGJ_c1QImW5YQ6cvEAKw) subsequently followed my discovery of them and I was not left disappointed. Every song on that EP is brilliant in it's own way and I really can't wait for more from this brilliant and unique band.

Earlier in the week I was looking back at other albums that released recently, mainly to look for more recommendations for my friend who had pointed out that they enjoyed a few singles I recommended. These came from Gustaf, a punky band from new york, one which I discovered through their great single [Dog](https://open.spotify.com/track/0uK8gLvvWEVVeLG95CPuh0?si=8e105422d3d643ad) which was played by Steve Lamacq on BBC 6 (I promise I'm not that old,,, yet). I love the strong drum beat (great to walk to!) and the amusing lyrics. The songs that I almost picked this week come from their second album and were [Here Hair](https://open.spotify.com/track/1lhLS5iHmYUSpKBcsqnZRD?si=267d1a3375a4479e) and [Hard Hair](https://open.spotify.com/track/6VgB77wE7o9LTyDk0AukcR?si=7da5c39704144aa7). These songs come as a pair, where the first half builds slowly with a driving guitar almost too fast for the beat. Slowly more and more instruments build up and up until it all falls away and the song finishes, you almost feel like something is missing, at which point Hard Hair jumps straight in and gives you the release you crave for the whole first section.

The other artist I was looking back at was Lambrini Girls, a two woman led punk duo who are really not afraid to talk about what they want. Honestly, I can't fault them and it's one of the reasons I love them so much. [Terf Wars](https://open.spotify.com/track/7aNvsOmhlc4V07PdT4YgtN?si=0f79a9b02b824ab1) has got to be one of my top songs from them, probably just because the problem is so personal to me and it feels great to shout about it (even if I'm not actually shouting). Their recent album [Who Let the Dogs Out](https://open.spotify.com/album/4GzF4Yg3GSkKi4hAzmjBKV?si=gVO9pnFnTOmwck3lS1sypQ) is a great culmination of many very pertinent issues in current times, including but not limited to police brutality, gentrification, body image issues and nepotism. It is this last subject that one of my favourite songs off the album [Filthy Rich Nepo Baby](https://open.spotify.com/track/0z0IR9uRtwPhfGAq4wKNlb?si=20c89064956d4b24) broaches, the short intro song "Scarcity is Fake (communist propaganda)" which is recording of Kwame Ture then leads into the heavy and growling guitars which I love so much. The lyrics are so fun to sing (more talk) along to and I really can't wait to see this song live, I can just imagine the chaos live.

Next week comes Courting's third album "Lust for Life" (no I will not put the whole title it is so long) and Fake Dads album "Holly Wholesome and the Slut Machine" a great title I know!

The track of the week:

### My Rant About "Prime Target"

What I have not been enjoying is "Prime Target", after a recent [toot](https://mathstodon.xyz/@bradheintz/113964404406035722) I saw, complaining that it mentioned prime every few seconds and calling it bad I thought how bad could it really be? Bad, really bad. As someone studying Mathematics at university, admittedly in quite a funny way. The first section of the show went fairly well, it sets the scene fairly well, with the mystery of what the main character(Edward Brooks) is working on. We understand he is one of those 'savant' type characters, one who is supposed to make the watcher assume what he says to be true and is quirky because every genius is this apparently? I think this illusion falls flat from my point of view as we get further into the show, namely the moment where Edward poses a question to the 'good' and 'bad' supervisors (as I shall put it).
    
He talks about the interesting property of a certain number, which turns out to be the sum of three consecutive squares (or something like this I can't really be bothered to go back and watch the episode). The 'good' supervisor instantly solves this, where the 'bad' says this is a silly game, before completing the puzzle at the end of the scene. Irregardless of the fact that very few mathematicians would just know this fact instantly, this felt very much like a silly cliche in that the bad person has some hints of being 'cool' in the respective subject of interest.

Watching further into the episode, we discover what is supposed to be a prime number generating formula in an ancient temple. We see the typical mad scrawling from Edward that is supposed the give the audience the idea that something magical is happening, quickly cut off with Edward running off to figure it out (I guess, he just says "I need to go"). Half of these notes are left with the 'bad' supervisor who apparently recognises this instantly as a prime number generating formula and starts working it out in his office the next day. We see a mystery observer take photos of this from a spy camera, which results in the supervisor being threatened for doing algebra. This eventually leads to the burning of all notes related to the prime number formula and the supervisor killing himself. Admittedly this does give quite an intriguing mystery about why such a group is banning research into a specific area and leads to somewhat of a cliffhanger to the first episode.

In the second episode we discover about a previous supervisee called Safiya who was also researching primes. Edward goes to the library to look into this more and when he searches for literature on primes in the most tv-centric way possible the total of four (yes four!) books on prime pop up along with a neat animation explaining that they are no longer available. I could help but laugh at this because it was so ridiculous.

Later into the episode we discover that the FBI is watching researchers in mathematics across different universities because they might discover something dangerous. One particular point that they bring up here is that "all you need to break into a computer is the right numbers", a concept that while I grasp what they were going for makes little sense in reality. At this point I basically zoned out of the second episode, one of the agents watching the researchers realises that the footage of the 'bad' supervisor killing himself is tampered with and the episode ends by the boss of this agent being shot (by mistake) for questioning this. It was at this point that I decided to stop because quite frankly I didn't see anything too interesting happening past this point. The one thing I did want to know was whether the sought after prime formula was shown on screen (and also how they justify that this just breaks security of _every_ computer, which is an insane thing to say, like at least try and talk about actual cryptography please...).
