            <p>This weekend I stayed in a quaint countryside town known as Chapel En
            Le Frith (despite what you might believe that is in fact not in France,
            but the Peaks) and next week I embark on a four day long distance
            walking journey. So I’ve decided this week to turn my attention to some
            songs that remind me of nature and greenery, this way you can sit down,
            close your eyes and imagine being there alongside me experiencing the
            wonderful British countryside. I’ve made a playlist, but I’ve selected a
            few from it to talk about here.</p>
            <p>“And I felt like the sea” - Green Gardens</p>
            <p>If you’ve seen my green gardens <a
            href="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0038893677_10.jpg">t-shirt</a> you might
            have thought it was some sort of nudist resort, well I’m here to confirm
            that is not the fact and they are actually a small indie-rock band
            hailing from Leeds. I think this band have a really inseparable link to
            the countryside for some reason, perhaps it was their music video for <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WZC6F2T-t8">Home in the Books</a>
            (interesting viewing lol) I watched which was partially filmed in the
            countryside, or perhaps it’s just the kind of vibes I get from their
            music. Either way I just can’t help but picture green rolling hills,
            moorland or a serene riverbank when I listen to their music.</p>
            <p>I like this song so much because you can listen to it in the
            background and let it be, it’s very calming and also very evocative of
            the sort of calmness you feel from just being outside for a while.</p>
            <p>“Storm To Pass” - Katy J Pearson</p>
            <p>This was the song that sparked the idea for this week’s song of the
            week. I think Katy has an interesting style which feels so calming
            which, particularly this song, evokes to mind a slow amble through soft
            grass with a warm breeze and the sun starting to set. I think the slow
            horns over the song and Katy’s great vocals blend so well into this song
            that feels reflective and beautiful.</p>
            <p>“Cowboy Nudes” - Geese</p>
            <p>Ok, this is maybe not English countryside, but it really does feel
            like I’m outside and having a good time, sat round a campfire with good
            friends. The title kinda hits it on the nail to be honest, it really
            evokes a cowboy sort of feel in all. I really appreciate the funky vibe
            which really adds to the summery vibes.</p>
