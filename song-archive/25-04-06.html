<h2 id="section">06/04/25</h2>
<p>On Saturday I has a 3 hour coach journey, so I planned ahead on
something fun to do. I settled on picking a theme for my song of the
week and trying to make a playlist that fit to this, then choosing my
favourite to become the song of the week. The theme I chose was “Long
songs”, one which was very heavily inspired (read: stolen) from my
wonderful friend <a href="https://deltzabar.github.io/">Sof</a> (see
their playlist <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6DhX6VblGRJbne6GlyUAI5?si=ee97acb650704e28">here</a>)!
As an arbitrary rule, I let myself pick songs that were 8 minutes or
longer (and hey who was I to judge if a few that were close enough got
through).</p>
<p>I think the reason I never really pick a theme for these is because
whenever someone asks me to pick something related to a theme, every
example just conveniently decides to take that time to leave my brain.
This, combined with the fact that the spotify mobile app refused to show
me song lengths without me first playing them, seemed like a bit of an
issue. In all reality it led to a nice session of me catching up on old
songs that I forgot about, mainly that of W.H.Lung and Squid. I will not
go through all the choices (because otherwise I would be writing for
hours), but pick some highlights out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amber Waves: I mean it’s Ethel Cain what do you expect from me
(perverts ftw)</li>
<li>The Wrong Side of History: I really loved regressive left for their
beautiful synths and dancy music. They were a really unashamedly
political band and one which I really respected for it. I love the
different phases of this song, which are linked well together and keep
it interesting enough to justify it’s length. Luckily the main singer
has gone on to create a new band “The Itch”, who have released one song
so far; <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1M3MkQsyHneKRo2LRlBrg3?si=705eb63e207447b8">Ursula</a>
a song which I instantly fell in love with.</li>
<li>Crap Art: I’ve really built myself a reputation of liking songs
where you just get talked at and The Cool Greenhouse are really not
helping me in this department. They definitely take some getting used
to, at one point in time their single “Alexa” was the only song by them
I found palatable. However over time I likened to their style of weird
stories and tales spoken to a backing track of strange guitars and
synth. This is their longest song and will definitely be a strange
listen for most people, but I do recommend trying some of their more
accessible songs such as <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5phlevcSVhsgout10jCQid?si=734db8ced70f459d">4Chan</a>
and <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3Ca2bHmcxlhzE3an2DBncY?si=c29593eab62c4995">Landlords</a>.</li>
<li>The Cleaner: The first time I was introduced to Squid, via their
song Houseplants, I found it funny that they were singing in such a
strange way (perhaps a side effect of the fact that the drummer is
singing). I don’t know that I really enjoyed the song at the time, but
I’ve certainly warmed well up to their post-punk sound now. The cleaner
is one of their older songs and has a dance-esque vibe, the guitars are
fun and light, the drums constant and interesting. I think one of the
main (albeit stupid) reasons I like the song so much is because it
reminds me of the Greg Davies BBC TV series ‘The Cleaner’, where Greg
plays the role of a crime scene cleaner who gets into lots of silly
mishaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The song of the week, comes from a small band local to me - NOT SOUP.
I saw them not too long ago supporting Keg and, not knowing what to
expect, I waited in anticipation for them to start. What I did not
expect was a prog rock, math rock mix. Not something I usually go to see
live, so I was a little nervous, but boy did they show me up. The
intricate and impressive guitar and poly rhythms ran over their long and
impressive songs. The lyrics were interesting and sung well with great
emphasis. The song I chose was one I felt is particularly pertinent and
one which is some of their best work.</p>
