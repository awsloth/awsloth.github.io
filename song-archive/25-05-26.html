<p>Before you start reading, you better get in a good catching position
because I’m about to hurl 5 songs at you real quick and then leave
(sorry got one last exam to be revising for).</p>

- Witch Fever &lt;- Song of the Week!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently discovered Witch Fever, through Bad Waitress - a band
whose album <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/album/45ekLgDqo4L7p5Q79tpQOV?si=PmhXx5hfS52e7GKnOvSmSw">No
Taste</a> I have a particular fondness for. Witch Fever feel like Bad
Waitress, but taken up a notch and more consistently heavy. As my friend
Sof said they are like Lambrini Girls, but less punk and more metal.</p>

- Fiona Apple</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This song was recommended to me (in a way) by my friend Jess. When I
first listened to this song I just couldn’t stop, it feels so smooth and
jazzy. I could imagine such a entertaining and fun dance to fit along to
this.</p>

Dysphoria Blues</a> - Against Me!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you Sof I love this one &lt;3</p>
<p>I sat and listened to this one before one of the exams I have been
most stressed for ever. It means so so much to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3QJtQCtKVX5rLNYEsy4CWA?si=0546a6c4adbf4617">Bloom
Baby Bloom</a> - Wolf Alice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New Wolf Alice! - I like this they feel proper rocky and while I like
their toned down songs, this is a fun direction and I await gleefully
for their new stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/46WOptLnXUtH3LOyYvmMO1?si=e3f41b75d0a74374">Welcome
to the World of the Plastic Beach</a> - Gorillaz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the way Gorillaz can blend genres, sometimes it works (see:
this song), sometimes it doesn’t (see: The Pink Phantom, what were they
thinking???). Snoop dog and a brass ensemble? Fuck yes give me more
please.</p>
