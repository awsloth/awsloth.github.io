Here are my opinions on some current media I am currently consuming!

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [A taste of linear logic](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/lineartaste/lineartaste-revised.pdf)

The books I am currently reading include:

> The Jungle - Upton Sinclair

I am re-reading this classic so I can write a review. I think it covers an interesting and important range of topics and I hope to get much out of it than last time I read it. Particularly because I am trying to improve my sense of important themes and ideas from books, a skill I have wanted to have for a while.

> An Introduction to Cybercultures - David Bell

Of what I have read so far Cybercultures covers a good deal of interesting topics. I think the language at times can be difficult to parse because of the academic nature of the text, but I have enjoyed the extra reading and the discussions on various ideas. These include how cyberspace will change communities and how it affects our daily lives. A section I haven't got to yet, but one I am excited for is that of identity.

I think this book offers a particularly interesting view because it is from 2000 and so where predictions occur it is interesting to see how accurate they are. It is also interesting to see how certain topics stay very much the same albeit with different context.

### Song of the Week

I was working up this week to write a long post, which will now have to wait til next week as it has become more work than I expected and I want to do it justice. Therefore this week I will talk about a couple new songs that have been released recently that I've been enjoying (only 2 because I've left this quite late).

The first time I saw Big Special was when they were supporting Deadletter and they were so incredibly different from anything I had seen before. It is very much spoken word, and even more so when live. Joe (the 'singer') stands with his mic loose in his hand and steps back and forth in a rocking motion, bellowing each word down the mic - you can tell he means every word. Meanwhile Callum (the drummer) sits at the back smashing the drum set to the words and a backing track accompanies them, but it just fills the blank space and doesn't take away from the pair's performance. It all culminates in an astounding sight and sound, one which is addictive and very encapsulating. Somewhat soon after this they released their first album, "Post Industrial Hometown Blues", which I really enjoyed. I think the songs themselves hold up well, but it's the lyrics that are so fun to explore and speak along to. They are enunciated with such power, almost as if performed as part of slam poetry.

After this success I forgot about Big Special for a while until just the other day I stumbled upon a music video for [God Save The Pony](https://open.spotify.com/track/3QrvKxTmQWIpI9cGE3HakK?si=38aa5db3b7e44f8a), from their new album "National Average". This came as a bit of a surprise to me as I had no idea they were releasing new stuff let alone a whole new album. I think this song takes a fun new direction, whilst keeping the key features that make them so good; the strong drums, the lyrics and the pronunciation. What I enjoy from the new additions is the distortion on vocals and the ever catchy bass and relentless staccato of the synth.

Last week I watched the Sprints set from Glastonbury and really enjoyed the new song they teased "Descartes". Unfortunately I got distracted by the cover of "Foundations" they played with Kate Nash that they clearly hadn't practised and so was quite cringe to watch. However, they released the track earlier this week and I have been enjoying it a lot since. It's got a lot of the classic Sprints sound to it, the fast guitar over the top, the noisy distorted guitar supporting and heavy drums in the back. I have been a bit annoyed with some of Sprint's stuff because it does feel all a bit similar but I feel they have branched out here more and it's a fun track (especially after having a bit of a stressful meeting).

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:

- Gilmore Girls
- Dungeon Meshi
- Heartbreak High (particularly enjoying the autism representation)

I would like to get round to re watching the Matrix trilogy (but not the new one - that's bad).

I recently also watched (in a movie marathon) all of the star wars episodes from 1-9. I will now give my ranking of these films (with a little comment for each), I hope you enjoy :)

1. A New Hope: A classic and well written film, good fun!
2. Return of the Jedi: The film is well written, interesting and cool to watch. Bonus points for ewoks, I love those guys.
3. The Phantom Menace: I have a lot of nostalgia from playing the lego star wars podracing which means I'm a bit biased, but also this is a great film anyway (if you just ignore jar jar binks existing and the stupid "there's always a bigger fish line" what were they on about)
4. The Empire Strikes Back: I do not like that the problem the whole time was just the millennium falcon breaking, stupid and annoying, I don't like Han.
5. The Clone Wars: C3PO getting turned into a robot was pretty fun
6. Revenge of the Sith: Noo, nooo, NOOOOO! You shall die (this did not justify why Anakin switched to the dark side at all, he just kinda went yup I guess I'll do that)
7. The Force Awakens: I thought the little attempt at looking at how stormtroopers were actually people was interesting until that dialogue abruptly just stopped.
8. The Last Jedi: Felt like a rehash of the empire strikes back but much worse (why did Leia just fly through space what the hellll)
9. The Rise of Skywalker: We watched this film at 1.5x speed to make it in any way watchable

I also recently watched The Accountant 2... I think we all know how that went based off of the less than great autism representation in the first film.
