Here are my opinions on some current media I am currently consuming!

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [A taste of linear logic](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/lineartaste/lineartaste-revised.pdf)

The books I am currently reading include:

> The Jungle - Upton Sinclair

I am re-reading this classic so I can write a review. I think it covers an interesting and important range of topics and I hope to get much out of it than last time I read it. Particularly because I am trying to improve my sense of important themes and ideas from books, a skill I have wanted to have for a while.

> An Introduction to Cybercultures - David Bell

Of what I have read so far Cybercultures covers a good deal of interesting topics. I think the language at times can be difficult to parse because of the academic nature of the text, but I have enjoyed the extra reading and the discussions on various ideas. These include how cyberspace will change communities and how it affects our daily lives. A section I haven't got to yet, but one I am excited for is that of identity.

I think this book offers a particularly interesting view because it is from 2000 and so where predictions occur it is interesting to see how accurate they are. It is also interesting to see how certain topics stay very much the same albeit with different context.

### Song of the Week

> To see the archive of previous weeks, see here: [Archive](/media/song-archive)

I am someone who very much struggles to live in the moment and looks ahead a lot. This can be good sometimes because it means that I usually try to plan things out thoroughly and so am pretty prepared when it comes to holidays, etc. However it has its drawbacks, in that when I'm anticipating change that I'm really not looking forward to I tend to live through it multiple times before it even happens. Torturing myself in anticipation of events that may not even be as bad as I'm expecting them to be. This means that I have to remind myself to enjoy the moments while they last and not be living as if they've already ended. With that said I'll leave you with a song that brings me some sort of comfort and I've listened to it a fair amount recently.

The song starts slow and quiet, the double thump of the drums almost echoing a heartbeat. The gentle up and down of the guitar combine with the occasional hit of the tambourine to almost feeling like waves crashing on a beach. We have a sort of introduction verse, at which point the song speeds up and the drums come in properly and then we hear the chorus. I find the lyrics to be somewhat simple, but interesting to think about; they repeat "If you only feel it once, is it enough?".

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:

- Gilmore Girls
- Dungeon Meshi
- Heartbreak High (particularly enjoying the autism representation)

I would like to get round to re watching the Matrix trilogy (but not the new one - that's bad).

I recently also watched (in a movie marathon) all of the star wars episodes from 1-9. I will now give my ranking of these films (with a little comment for each), I hope you enjoy :)

1. A New Hope: A classic and well written film, good fun!
2. Return of the Jedi: The film is well written, interesting and cool to watch. Bonus points for ewoks, I love those guys.
3. The Phantom Menace: I have a lot of nostalgia from playing the lego star wars podracing which means I'm a bit biased, but also this is a great film anyway (if you just ignore jar jar binks existing and the stupid "there's always a bigger fish line" what were they on about)
4. The Empire Strikes Back: I do not like that the problem the whole time was just the millennium falcon breaking, stupid and annoying, I don't like Han.
5. The Clone Wars: C3PO getting turned into a robot was pretty fun
6. Revenge of the Sith: Noo, nooo, NOOOOO! You shall die (this did not justify why Anakin switched to the dark side at all, he just kinda went yup I guess I'll do that)
7. The Force Awakens: I thought the little attempt at looking at how stormtroopers were actually people was interesting until that dialogue abruptly just stopped.
8. The Last Jedi: Felt like a rehash of the empire strikes back but much worse (why did Leia just fly through space what the hellll)
9. The Rise of Skywalker: We watched this film at 1.5x speed to make it in any way watchable

I also recently watched The Accountant 2... I think we all know how that went based off of the less than great autism representation in the first film.
