            <p>This weeks track comes from Honeyglaze’s second album <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/album/20QRMueqfMw1nHWOfXZGOL?si=qFAp0UNWQqW7hOxgizlbBw">Real
            Deal</a>. This album was released last year and is one which I don’t
            think I appreciated enough at the time of release (albeit I listened to
            ‘Pretty Girls’ a hell of a lot - it was one of my top 20 songs in 2024).
            The other day as I was walking to the climbing gym, listening to my <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/70VLAlhpQ1goYABjtaWsIU?si=4a8a67fc0c884ba3">stupidly
            long playlist</a> on shuffle the song I have picked came on. It is such
            a great song to round off the album, as the song rounds off you are left
            with a sort of reminiscent and retrospective feeling.</p>
            <p>As mentioned last week I thought that Sports Team’s album “Boys these
            days” was going to release Friday, unfortunately Wikipedia lied to me.
            Instead their single “Maybe When We Are 30” was released, while this
            song was a contender it felt sort of cliché to name a song and choose
            it, unless it was particularly outstanding.</p>
            <p>Next week I really looking forward to Divorce’s debut album “Drive to
            Goldenhammer”, I have thoroughly enjoyed the singles being released up
            to this point, in particular <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4SqWJA9Yq8PGqhaXcLlENN?si=4fabf2c3f5e34f82">Pill</a>.
            Another album coming out next week is that of Hot Wax, namely “Hot
            Shock”. See you next week!</p>
