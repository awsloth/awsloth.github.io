## 16/03/25

This week has been a bit of a throwback in terms of music. This was mainly due to the fantastic cover of [Head Over Heels](https://open.spotify.com/track/2w7MvUzOvRXZCjFEV7tahC?si=a4afe3c1ab994831) by She's in Parties. They have put their lovely ethereal touch on the song, with synths over the original piano. I really love the touch of the lead singers voice - it feels much less talk-y than the original and the song feels overall more smooth.

This song caused me to remember a cover of [Careless Whisper](https://open.spotify.com/track/0cvW31FIK6B3mUqWLUHorv?si=0e3864cf7d784b54) by Chicago band Brigitte Calls Me Baby. The band themselves feel really nostalgic of the 80s vibes and I cannot recommend their self written songs. I originally discovered them on YouTube through a recording of one of their shows in Minneapolis and it is just incredible (see: [here](https://youtu.be/H_OC1Po62Rs?si=XU4pjvf7Y6QemMks)). The singer has such a smooth voice and one that really fits the retro theme of their music.

Before we get to the song of the week, I figured I would mention a song that I have been loving (albeit one that doesn't really fit the theme that seems to have sort of shown up). This is [Photo Day](https://open.spotify.com/track/33xc1xV00ATu5B7yU6TLm1?si=592c4c7835d640fc), the first song in Keg's debut album. This came quite a surprise to me, but it was more than welcome and I have thoroughly enjoyed all the songs on this album. I think this song stood out to me so much because of the quiet, almost solemn, trumpet which slowly builds up with guitars joining in slowly up and up until you are left with a sort of fuzzy sound. This breaks through to Keg's signature cacophony of loud trumpet, guitar and spoken word lyrics. As usual with Keg the lyrics are part of some strange story (see: Kids, Michael Phelps), but I think this song has a nice mix of their classic sound and some more optimistic, light sound, particularly with more soft trumpet mixed into the more heavy.

Recently I saw that the lead singer of Soda Blonde, Faye, sang with David Bowie's band in an orchestra type set up and one of the songs she sang was "Five Years", the smallest snippet of this reminded me of just how great and album this came from. I cannot fault a single song in the nearly 40 minutes playtime and why should I? The album is considered a classic and it really has stood the test of time. From "Starman" to "Ziggy Stardust" and "Moonage Daydream" the songs just hit every time. For this week I chose the song that reminded me of the album "Five Years". I really love the storytelling over the whole album and this song sets the scene so well. Earth has used up all of its resources and will be destroyed in five years (feels somewhat relevant eh?). It's quite a melancholy song, but it's dramatic and actually quite beautiful in of itself.

This week has been a real turning point in the weather, having consistent double digit temperatures and sunny warm days has meant I've enjoyed a lot more time outside. I think the song I have chosen really captures the sort of playful and joyous feeling I'm getting from the coming of spring. Ugly are a band I discovered back in March this year, they were supporting Bleach Lab at the Hare and Hounds, a wonderfully intimate venue and one very reminiscient of my favourite Leeds venue, the Brudenell. Having never listened to them before the night, but being vaguely aware of their existence I didn't really know what to expect. A weird mish mash of country-esque tones, soft guitar and layered vocals was not what I was expecting, nevertheless it was a hugely pleasant surpise. Their EP [Twice Around the Sun](https://open.spotify.com/album/3wzMjiyIQ2zDv3suwSHxpp?si=i2MGJ_c1QImW5YQ6cvEAKw) subsequently followed my discovery of them and I was not left dissappointed. Every song on that EP is brilliant in it's own way and I really can't wait for more from this brilliant and unique band.

Earlier in the week I was looking back at other albums that released recently, mainly to look for more recommendations for my friend who had pointed out that they enjoyed a few singles I recommended. These came from Gustaf, a punky band from new york, one which I discovered through their great single [Dog](https://open.spotify.com/track/0uK8gLvvWEVVeLG95CPuh0?si=8e105422d3d643ad) which was played by Steve Lamacq on BBC 6 (I promise I'm not that old,,, yet). I love the strong drum beat (great to walk to!) and the amusing lyrics. The songs that I almost picked this week come from their second album and were [Here Hair](https://open.spotify.com/track/1lhLS5iHmYUSpKBcsqnZRD?si=267d1a3375a4479e) and [Hard Hair](https://open.spotify.com/track/6VgB77wE7o9LTyDk0AukcR?si=7da5c39704144aa7). These songs come as a pair, where the first half builds slowly with a driving guitar almost too fast for the beat. Slowly more and more instruments build up and up until it all falls away and the song finishes, you almost feel like something is missing, at which point Hard Hair jumps straight in and gives you the release you crave for the whole first section.

The other artist I was looking back at was Lambrini Girls, a two woman led punk duo who are really not afraid to talk about what they want. Honestly, I can't fault them and it's one of the reasons I love them so much. [Terf Wars](https://open.spotify.com/track/7aNvsOmhlc4V07PdT4YgtN?si=0f79a9b02b824ab1) has got to be one of my top songs from them, probably just because the problem is so personal to me and it feels great to shout about it (even if I'm not actually shouting). Their recent album [Who Let the Dogs Out](https://open.spotify.com/album/4GzF4Yg3GSkKi4hAzmjBKV?si=gVO9pnFnTOmwck3lS1sypQ) is a great culmination of many very pertinent issues in current times, including but not limited to police brutality, gentrification, body image issues and nepotism. It is this last subject that one of my favourite songs off the album [Filthy Rich Nepo Baby](https://open.spotify.com/track/0z0IR9uRtwPhfGAq4wKNlb?si=20c89064956d4b24) broaches, the short intro song "Scarcity is Fake (communist propoganda)" which is recording of Kwame Ture then leads into the heavy and growling guitars which I love so much. The lyrics are so fun to sing (more talk) along to and I really can't wait to see this song live, I can just imagine the chaos live.

## 02/03/25

This weeks track comes from Honeyglaze's second album [Real Deal](https://open.spotify.com/album/20QRMueqfMw1nHWOfXZGOL?si=qFAp0UNWQqW7hOxgizlbBw). This album was released last year and is one which I don't think I appreciated enough at the time of release (albeit I listened to 'Pretty Girls' a hell of a lot - it was one of my top 20 songs in 2024). The other day as I was walking to the climbing gym, listening to my [stupidly long playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/70VLAlhpQ1goYABjtaWsIU?si=4a8a67fc0c884ba3) on shuffle the song I have picked came on. It is such a great song to round off the album, as the song rounds off you are left with a sort of reminiscent and retrospective feeling.

As mentioned last week I thought that Sports Team's album "Boys these days" was going to release Friday, unfortunately Wikipedia lied to me. Instead their single "Maybe When We Are 30" was released, while this song was a contender it felt sort of clich√© to name a song and choose it, unless it was particularly outstanding.

Next week I really looking forward to Divorce's debut album "Drive to Goldenhammer", I have thoroughly enjoyed the singles being released up to this point, in particular [Pill](https://open.spotify.com/track/4SqWJA9Yq8PGqhaXcLlENN?si=4fabf2c3f5e34f82). Another album coming out next week is that of HotWax, namely "Hot Shock". See you next week!


## 23/02/25

The song of the week this week comes from a band called "Mandrake Handshake". I discovered this band about 3 years ago now (funnily enough from a [t-shirt](https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/299058000/WhatsApp+Image+2021-03-16+at+09.36.49.jpeg?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200) I bought from their label at the time) and have loved their groovy, psychedelic noise ever since. They are formed of 10 (yes ten) members which is honestly crazy to me, I do not know how they fit on any stages.

Just last Friday they released their 50 minute debut album [Earth-Sized Worlds](https://open.spotify.com/album/4cLeoigCgulrTWiYszW61K?si=CVe3aRTTQ8uLr0pritXo2w), which I cannot recommend enough, and is where the track of the week comes from. Also last Friday came Sam Fender's third studio album [People Watching](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Abecbed8BYAdHy9RaVoY7?si=mHSqnUxqT8uHrOoNvxqVNg), also a great album and one which made it difficult to pick my favourite song this week. I particularly like [Nostalgia's Lie](https://open.spotify.com/track/10MJWoKUV6AthUYR323MqB?si=8711c08855b4409c), but felt that it did not best the track I have selected. See you next week, where I look forward to hearing Sports Team's new album "Boys these Days" (the single [Bang Bang Bang](https://open.spotify.com/track/6SZiBRJYG3rd3yiU4PDsxZ?si=45a24f6883fa4e73) is simply amazing), I particularly look forward to the track "Maybe When We're Thirty" which was incredibly to hear live in a hometown venue back in November.
