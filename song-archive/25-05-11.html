            <p>I know I promised that I would write a long one last week (and I
            still might), but I am delaying that topic because I am having a severe
            memory gap on that one. I very much still plan to write what I had
            planned but I haven’t got what I want ready for it.</p>
            <p>Ok so, what am I going to cover this week? The oddities, the weirdos,
            the guys I don’t listen to that often. This week in particular I’ve
            gotten very bored of my usual music and have branched out into more
            chill and relaxing songs (not saying I <em>don’t</em> have those in my
            normal rotation, just that these are particularly different).</p>
            <p>Let’s first take a look at Tome Misch. I stumbled this week upon a
            reupload of one of his quarantine songs, this being his cover of <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dSCFMesnm8">never too much</a>
            (the original sadly no longer exists). The quality is kinda shit but the
            vibe really shines through; he is so slick just freestyling and it’s
            always a pleasure to hear him at work. The little trickling slide he
            does at the start feels so satisfying, like a few raindrops gently
            falling onto you.</p>
            <p>As mentioned prior, this comes from the suite of songs he did during
            quarantine - a lot of which I really love. In particular I still
            remember seeing <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1yGWCxz5fQRlage1xAhLjP?si=a1192c5feacc464e">Chain
            Reaction</a> for the first time, it’s such an earworm. The live mixing
            by Jordan is really quite impressive and all the little attentions to
            detail make it so fun to re-listen to. I’ve got to admit I was caught by
            surprise by the singing towards the end when I was re-listening today,
            but I think it is a nice touch and rounds out the song nicely; vocals
            from Jordon never go amiss.</p>
            <p>If you want any more recommendations, please ask! I love so so much
            of Tom’s music and I’d be very happy to talk about it.</p>
            <p>Now onto some classical stuff! I’ve never listened to that much
            classical (apart from when I was my ballet classes), so the stuff I do
            listen to is few and far between. I think I always run to it in times of
            stress (see: sixth form exams and current exams) probably because
            classical music is generally considered to be pretty calming (more on
            this later). One of the composers I particularly like is Erik Satie, in
            particular the Gymnopédies. They are referenced everywhere and honestly
            you can’t beat the originals (ironic, given that I did select the cover
            from Tapir! for song of the week previously I know), they are timeless
            and so so good. Another composer I particularly like is Claude Debussy,
            his “Clair De Lune” is iconic for a reason and his various other work
            makes for some great listening.</p>
            <p>The last piece of classical music I would like to talk about is the
            absolute masterpiece that is Igor Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring”. Sorry
            if I have already yapped to you about it a lot but I just think it’s
            such a cool and striking piece of music, especially the story around
            it’s release and the original ballet that went with it. It feels so
            outside of the normal range for what I would consider classical music,
            so I find it really interesting. Especially because I first heard it
            when watching Phoenix Dance Theatre’s own interpretation of the original
            ballet, looking into Haitian voodoo background and traditions, it was
            super super cool to see and actually learn some of the dances from! I
            think for these reasons it is one of my favourite pieces of music ever
            and I would strongly consider it to be one of my so called “desert
            island discs”.</p>
            <p>On a purely nostalgic basis, my song of the week is Movie by Tom
            Misch. I remember sometime in sixth form doing this thing where I would
            record me dancing to songs I liked at the time in my bedroom. I
            particularly remember practicing to this song, probably just because of
            the really memorable intro. Before you ask, no I don’t remember any of
            the dances and no you cannot see them (I think they are lost to the void
            anyway).</p>
