Apart from Duke of Edinburgh and expeditions I did with Scouts, this was one of the first long walks I ever did. I was originally supposed to do the Dales Way, a walk pretty local to me and a walk I still intend to complete at some point, but I ended up getting covid beforehand and only recovered to do the last day.

For this walk, my friend Bram and I had planned to go to the Lake District. After looking through the generally walked ways, we eventually decided that none really fit what we wanted and just decided to plot our own route. This, rather stupidly, involved us spending a couple hours on OS Maps website with their route making tool and plotting to interesting places on the map. This led to a lot of beautiful sights along the way, but also some other problems (subtle foreshadowing).

### Day 1: Windermere to Grasmere

We started the walk on the 8th of August, after a 2 and a half hour long drive, we arrived in Windermere. After a short stop at Booths (luxury!), we set off on the short 11 mile walk, a nice warm up for the walk to come. We headed up into the hills on the east of lake windermere, eventually getting a lovely, albeit overcast, view over the valley.

A good section of fields later, we descended back down into the valley and entered the town of Ambleside. We stopped here for lunch in Rothay Park before the last small section to Grasmere. The last section was relatively flat, following a river and through a forest in sections. This took relatively little time and so we arrived early at the youth hostel for the night.

### Day 2: Grasmere to Conister

It was at the start of this day my curse of heatwaves started (now what seems to be a constant on my walking trips, regardless of how far in advance we book). This, combined with the 13 miles and 1.7km of ascent, did not bode hugely well. We started with the ascent up to Easdale Tarn, well worth the long climb, for the great views it providded.

It was at this point the path decided it no longer wanted to be walked on. We made our way around the edge of the lake and towards the end of the valley, what was a well trodded path because a scramble. After a bit of a struggle we ended up among the peaks, I wish I could have said it was a beautiful view, but it was really quite foggy at this point. We slowly made our way along the tops towards angle tarn, one of many spots along the way which were great for a swim.

It was around this point that one of the members of our group started struggling and we had to separate ways, this had also slowed us down throughout the day and our original plan to hike up Great Gable was not looking particularly pleasant. We instead opted for windy gap, a particularly horrible bit of scree, but one that was about 100m less of climb. After this particularly rough bit of climbing, we were left with great views but at least another 2 hours of walking.

It was at this point we were drawing closer to our stop for the night - Dubs Hut - a mountain bothy. These make for great basic accomodation while hiking and I have since sought them out to visit them. For me, it's always great fun to just be out in the middle of nowhere, especially waking up and doing your daily routines in the countryside is such a nice break. As we approached where we thought the bothy was, we discovered just how hard it is to spot a *slate* hut in a *slate* mine (who would have thought it). After scouring what turned out to be just an empty boulderfield, we moved on and, after coming through a turn in the valley, spotted the slightly distinct grey box in the sea of slate. We ended up finishing this day around seven thirty, really quite late.

### Day 3: Conister to Keswick

We had originally planned this day to hike to Keswick via Catbells, but instead opted for a shorter and flatter walk along Derwentwater. This tooks us over the mountain pass north of Seatoller, before following the river Derwent all the way to Derwentwater. Given the ongoing heatwave, this was yet another great opportunity to take a swim. We mostly took this day as an opportunity to relax and as a result I didn't end up taking any photos unfortunately.

### Day 4: Keswick to YHA Helvellyn

The main struggle for this day was Helvellyn, one of the higher peaks in the Lake District, standing at 950m (only 28m off Scarfell Pike - the tallest mountain in England). We also planned to walk along striding edge, what could at best be described as a scramble and one which we were going down backwards. The start of the day felt mostly like a blur, I had the long climb ahead as my main focus. As we neared the bottom of Hellvellyn, we stopped at the local townhall for a few snacks. It was after this break we discovered just how steep the climb would be (and apparently that there was some sort of natural infinity pool nearby?). Turns out that the path was pretty vertical and it didn't help that the peak kept feeling closer, only for it to be a false summit.

Eventually we neared the ridge on which Hevellyn lay, at this point we gave up our push and took a stop for lunch. The amount of climb still left was daunting, especially after the climb we had already done. We had stopped in a mountain pass, so we could very clearly see the next climb along to the next peak, one of many on the way to the last. It was after this climb we got out first view of Helvellyn. We could see the remaing climb to be done for the peak, something that was quite reassuring - we had done the majority of the climb.

After an hour or so, we made it to the peak! It was incredibly windy, but certainly among the highpoints of the trip (quite literally). We had set a tough goal and committed to it - something that we had previously given up on. We then had to tackle striding edge, quite the scramble and something to be taken slowly and carefully, especialy with our big packs on.

We naturally had a swim in the tarn just below the peak. The walk from then on felt almost like a victory lap, we had a few miles to go to our hostel - YHA Helvellyn. A really quite rural hostel which was situated halfway down the mountain and one which had a stream right outside the window, a great end to the day.

### Day 5: Helvellyn to Windermere

The last day was a long day, not only because of the distance (15.6 miles), but because at this point we mostly just wanted to finish. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy this day, but the last hour or so was very much a slog. This day ended up being a walk from mountain pass to mountain pass in order to get all the way back south to Windermere. The last section was just a repeat from the first day and so went like a blur.
