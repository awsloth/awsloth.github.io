I am a maths and computer science student at the University of Birmingham. Current interests include Category Theory, Type Theory, Proof Assistants, and Domain Theory. In my spare time I enjoy crochet, [walking](/about/walking), cooking and celeste.

If you want to find me elsewhere I am on [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/awsloth), [Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@awsloth), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/njuav1quxpqzgp8tyhkfba5on).
