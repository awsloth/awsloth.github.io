I will list my (very uninformed) opinions on current media I am currently interacting with (Last updated 24/03/25).

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [What is algebraic about algebraic effects and handlers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05923)
- [Probability monads with submonads of deterministic states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07003)
- [Domain Theory: An Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05858)

The books I am currently reading include:

> Around the World in 80 Games - Marcus du Sautoy

Although I haven't read much of this book, the section I have read has been captivating and interesting.

> Category Theory - Steve Awodey

A textbook on basics of Category Theory, one which is supposedly an easier read than "Category Theory for the Working Mathematician" by Saunders Mac Lane. While I agree with this, it really doesn't say much considering Mac Lane is notoriously hard to read (I have only really been able to understand the content post understanding the concepts from elsewhere). I think this book while good in places (particularly in the exponentials chapter) also focuses on concepts that can be confusing far too early (e.g. freely generated categories from graphs) and misses interesting contents that could be covered earlier, such as natural transformations. Overall I am enjoying it so far and it has become my primary source of learning for Category Theory, with supplements from elsewhere when the text gets too confusing.

### Song of the Week

Apologies all for the delayed song of the week - I literally did not sleep yesterday (see: https://devpost.com/software/floorplan) so I hope you can appreciate the situation.

Earlier this week I rediscovered the youtube channel of the independent music house State 51 conspiracy. They host small bands and upload recordings of their performances, really cool stuff right? Anyway, I got to watching a lot of the recent stuff, the main highlight being [Getdown Services](https://youtu.be/6HwclLOAe5Y?si=kODPtXeOXtH5pIFi) - the remix of Dancing Queen is quite something! All this reminded me of one of the craziest recordings I had seen - that being of [Tapir!](https://youtu.be/6cNaMVvBrXA?si=cTqwmglQ3sz2Dml6), the set features not only costume theming and set design, but a whole ass set of dancers, so much effort. The first song "Act 1 (The Pilgrim)" is so playful and light one of my favourite parts is just how satisfying and carefree the whistling sounds. The song of the week comes from the album that this song belongs to "The Pilgrim, Their God and The King of My Decrepit Mountain" an interesting mish mash of many different sounds. Cello, trumpet, guitar, drums, keyboard and chorus mix together to make beautiful and truly unique songs. The song of the week plays on Erik Satie's Gymnop√©dies, one of my favourite classical songs, taking some of the melodies, but also fleshing it out into it's own thing entirely. It's a really interesting take on the song and I cannot recommend it enough.

Aside from this I've been enjoying Divorce's debut album "Drive to Goldenhammer", an album that I regret not mentioning in previews weeks. From "Jet Show" to "Hangman" to and finally to "Mercy", this album really does not miss. I'm so so impressed with the quality that this band puts out and really can't wait to see what they put out next. My favourite song from the album is [Old Broken String](https://open.spotify.com/track/106QxLbImPeGaatF3TecJf?si=1ac9d5f87ec840ff), when I first listened to it I was eating breakfast and idly staring out the window. The song has a slow drum beat and strings, with a beautiful duet and in this first listen just felt like it just enveloped me inside of it.

The track of the week:

### My Rant About "Prime Target"

What I have not been enjoying is "Prime Target", after a recent [toot](https://mathstodon.xyz/@bradheintz/113964404406035722) I saw, complaining that it mentioned prime every few seconds and calling it bad I thought how bad could it really be? Bad, really bad. As someone studying Mathematics at university, admittedly in quite a funny way. The first section of the show went fairly well, it sets the scene fairly well, with the mystery of what the main character(Edward Brooks) is working on. We understand he is one of those 'savant' type characters, one who is supposed to make the watcher assume what he says to be true and is quirky because every genius is this apparently? I think this illusion falls flat from my point of view as we get further into the show, namely the moment where Edward poses a question to the 'good' and 'bad' supervisors (as I shall put it).
    
He talks about the interesting property of a certain number, which turns out to be the sum of three consecutive squares (or something like this I can't really be bothered to go back and watch the episode). The 'good' supervisor instantly solves this, where the 'bad' says this is a silly game, before completing the puzzle at the end of the scene. Irregardless of the fact that very few mathematicians would just know this fact instantly, this felt very much like a silly cliche in that the bad person has some hints of being 'cool' in the respective subject of interest.

Watching further into the episode, we discover what is supposed to be a prime number generating formula in an ancient temple. We see the typical mad scrawling from Edward that is supposed the give the audience the idea that something magical is happening, quickly cut off with Edward running off to figure it out (I guess, he just says "I need to go"). Half of these notes are left with the 'bad' supervisor who apparently recognises this instantly as a prime number generating formula and starts working it out in his office the next day. We see a mystery observer take photos of this from a spy camera, which results in the supervisor being threatened for doing algebra. This eventually leads to the burning of all notes related to the prime number formula and the supervisor killing himself. Admittedly this does give quite an intriguing mystery about why such a group is banning research into a specific area and leads to somewhat of a cliffhanger to the first episode.

In the second episode we discover about a previous supervisee called Safiya who was also researching primes. Edward goes to the library to look into this more and when he searches for literature on primes in the most tv-centric way possible the total of four (yes four!) books on prime pop up along with a neat animation explaining that they are no longer available. I could help but laugh at this because it was so ridiculous.

Later into the episode we discover that the FBI is watching researchers in mathematics across different universities because they might discover something dangerous. One particular point that they bring up here is that "all you need to break into a computer is the right numbers", a concept that while I grasp what they were going for makes little sense in reality. At this point I basically zoned out of the second episode, one of the agents watching the researchers realises that the footage of the 'bad' supervisor killing himself is tampered with and the episode ends by the boss of this agent being shot (by mistake) for questioning this. It was at this point that I decided to stop because quite frankly I didn't see anything too interesting happening past this point. The one thing I did want to know was whether the sought after prime formula was shown on screen (and also how they justify that this just breaks security of _every_ computer, which is an insane thing to say, like at least try and talk about actual cryptography please...).
