I will list my (very uninformed) opinions on current media I am currently interacting with (Last updated 20/04/25).

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [Domain Theory: An Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05858)
- A lot of my friends dissertations

The books I am currently reading include:

> Around the World in 80 Games - Marcus du Sautoy

Although I haven't read much of this book, the section I have read has been captivating and interesting.

> An Introduction to Cybercultures - David Bell

I have been really enjoying what I have read of this book so far. I think partially because it is very of its time (one which I was not yet even alive for), but also because it dives in depth into different section of computing and how people interact with cyberspace. Look forward to a review on this one because it really promises to be interesting!

### Song of the Week

> To see the archive of previous weeks, see here: [Archive](/media/song-archive)

To quote someone's dad:

> RISE  
  RISE  
  Where's your anger?  
  Where's your fucking rage?  

If you haven't got it already I'm going to choose some songs that feel angry and feisty. This was precipitated by the fucking terrible day I had earlier in the week, mostly because of the terrible terrible media coverage of the supreme courts ruling, but also because my bank fucking sucks (go figure). Before we jump into some tracks, I'll outline what I look for in these types of song, mainly this is:
- Heavy drums
- Growling and loud guitar
- Screaming/Loud shouting lyrics (extra points for having lyrics I can *really* get behind)
- Distortion

I've introduced them before, but because this song felt extremely relevant to the current moment I have chosen Lambrini Girls' [Terf Wars](https://open.spotify.com/track/7aNvsOmhlc4V07PdT4YgtN?si=34991ad5697248cc) as my song of the week. When I went to a concert of theirs a couple weeks ago, I really couldn't have felt more at home. The room was full of trans people and alternative looking people. The main singer, Phoebe, really knew how to work the crowd and made sure people felt safe and included. I think the chants she did felt extremely cathartic and it really felt like a proper community. It was one of the first times I haven't felt so helpless about the state of the world in a long time.

Supporting Lambrini Girls at the concert was Alien Chicks, a band I had thoroughly enjoyed before seeing them live, but one I was very happy to see perform. I have chosen their song [Candlestick Maker](https://open.spotify.com/track/2a4u1DkUlDNRnkWBVQoeer?si=79161c7b32cd4d78) in particular because I love the scream/shout they include. It feels very satisfying to catch it in time and the instrumentation throughout the song feels heavy in the right way. The voice on the edge of screaming, the mish mash of instruments in kinda the best way and the best of it all cowbell (the holy grail in post punk bands imo).

The third band I want to focus on is Coach Party, with two of theirs songs [Micro Aggression](https://open.spotify.com/track/0AoVDlD4Da25HVGUpM0liK?si=74e312acccc14639) and [Parasite](https://open.spotify.com/track/4EDSWFoLE7TgCrl0Eol9dV?si=5b9c75272a5644e3). For Parasite, there is not much more to say than it fits all my required categories. It is unfortunately not too long, but I can forgive them because it really is just a scream filled song. In terms of Micro Aggression, it's just a classic indie rock kinda feel, with some added screams/shouts for fun, with a message I can (obviously) get behind - great! 

Less of a song recommendation, more of a whole fuck off album. The debut album by Model/Actriz, [Dogsbody](https://open.spotify.com/album/1DWLFwBZxTSBWw7G9uhpok?si=06PXTio5Qkuv6Rwmr5M10Q), has become my go to "put me in the mines" album. I turn my headphones right up, blast the songs out and can't have any other thoughts but work (maybe not the healthiest thing, but I do at least enjoy the music). It may not directly fit into the rage theme, but if I was already angry I could really channel it through this (~~probably to send like a slightly angry email~~).

Here's to hoping next week is more of a positive note - though I am still looking to channel my rage at the right people do not worry. See you next week!

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:
- Dungeon Meshi (or Delicious in Dungeon)
- Wheel of Time

I really want to rewatch the original matrix trilogy, but due to the period of 'exam season' existing I have as of yet failed to watch more than 10 minutes of the first film.
