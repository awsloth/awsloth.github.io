            This weekend I travelled to Leeds to go to Live at Leeds (in the city). This is a yearly up and coming festival over the course of a Saturday with bands playing across many different venues around the city. Now if you know me, this is right up my street and in fact it has been a yearly tradition of mine to go to it. For each band/artist that I saw I'm going to give my favourite song that they played and maybe a little about how it was seeing them live. For all of these bands (apart from Katy J Pearson), this was actually my first time seeing them all play!

            <h3>Honeyglaze</h3>

            We started the day off with Honeyglaze. A band I've been familiar with for a while and one I've actually talked about before see <a href="/song-archive/25-03-02.html">here</a> (fun to see how much my writing has changed since then!). Their shoegazey sound has matured into a more indie rock style over the years, but has kept some of their roots, especially in tracks such as "Movies" one of my favourites that they played live (and which they dedicated to ratatouille, based). My favourite track that they played probably has to be "Childish Things".
