            <p>I am someone who very much struggles to live in the moment and looks
            ahead a lot. This can be good sometimes because it means that I usually
            try to plan things out thoroughly and so am pretty prepared when it
            comes to holidays, etc. However it has its drawbacks, in that when I’m
            anticipating change that I’m really not looking forward to I tend to
            live through it multiple times before it even happens. Torturing myself
            in anticipation of events that may not even be as bad as I’m expecting
            them to be. This means that I have to remind myself to enjoy the moments
            while they last and not be living as if they’ve already ended. With that
            said I’ll leave you with a song that brings me some sort of comfort and
            I’ve listened to it a fair amount recently.</p>
            <p>The song starts slow and quiet, the double thump of the drums almost
            echoing a heartbeat. The gentle up and down of the guitar combine with
            the occasional hit of the tambourine to almost feeling like waves
            crashing on a beach. We have a sort of introduction verse, at which
            point the song speeds up and the drums come in properly and then we hear
            the chorus. I find the lyrics to be somewhat simple, but interesting to
            think about; they repeat “If you only feel it once, is it enough?”.</p>
