<h2 id="section">09/03/25</h2>
<p>This week has been a real turning point in the weather, having
consistent double digit temperatures and sunny warm days has meant I’ve
enjoyed a lot more time outside. I think the song I have chosen really
captures the sort of playful and joyous feeling I’m getting from the
coming of spring. Ugly are a band I discovered back in March this year,
they were supporting Bleach Lab at the Hare and Hounds, a wonderfully
intimate venue and one very reminiscient of my favourite Leeds venue,
the Brudenell. Having never listened to them before the night, but being
vaguely aware of their existence I didn’t really know what to expect. A
weird mish mash of country-esque tones, soft guitar and layered vocals
was not what I was expecting, nevertheless it was a hugely pleasant
surpise. Their EP <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3wzMjiyIQ2zDv3suwSHxpp?si=i2MGJ_c1QImW5YQ6cvEAKw">Twice
Around the Sun</a> subsequently followed my discovery of them and I was
not left dissappointed. Every song on that EP is brilliant in it’s own
way and I really can’t wait for more from this brilliant and unique
band.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week I was looking back at other albums that released
recently, mainly to look for more recommendations for my friend who had
pointed out that they enjoyed a few singles I recommended. These came
from Gustaf, a punky band from new york, one which I discovered through
their great single <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0uK8gLvvWEVVeLG95CPuh0?si=8e105422d3d643ad">Dog</a>
which was played by Steve Lamacq on BBC 6 (I promise I’m not that old,,,
yet). I love the strong drum beat (great to walk to!) and the amusing
lyrics. The songs that I almost picked this week come from their second
album and were <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1lhLS5iHmYUSpKBcsqnZRD?si=267d1a3375a4479e">Here
Hair</a> and <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6VgB77wE7o9LTyDk0AukcR?si=7da5c39704144aa7">Hard
Hair</a>. These songs come as a pair, where the first half builds slowly
with a driving guitar almost too fast for the beat. Slowly more and more
instruments build up and up until it all falls away and the song
finishes, you almost feel like something is missing, at which point Hard
Hair jumps straight in and gives you the release you crave for the whole
first section.</p>
<p>The other artist I was looking back at was Lambrini Girls, a two
woman led punk duo who are really not afraid to talk about what they
want. Honestly, I can’t fault them and it’s one of the reasons I love
them so much. <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7aNvsOmhlc4V07PdT4YgtN?si=0f79a9b02b824ab1">Terf
Wars</a> has got to be one of my top songs from them, probably just
because the problem is so personal to me and it feels great to shout
about it (even if I’m not actually shouting). Their recent album <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4GzF4Yg3GSkKi4hAzmjBKV?si=gVO9pnFnTOmwck3lS1sypQ">Who
Let the Dogs Out</a> is a great culmination of many very pertinent
issues in current times, including but not limited to police brutality,
gentrification, body image issues and nepotism. It is this last subject
that one of my favourite songs off the album <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0z0IR9uRtwPhfGAq4wKNlb?si=20c89064956d4b24">Filthy
Rich Nepo Baby</a> broaches, the short intro song “Scarcity is Fake
(communist propoganda)” which is recording of Kwame Ture then leads into
the heavy and growling guitars which I love so much. The lyrics are so
fun to sing (more talk) along to and I really can’t wait to see this
song live, I can just imagine the chaos live.</p>
