## 23/02/25

The song of the week this week comes from a band called "Mandrake Handshake". I discovered this band about 3 years ago now (funnily enough from a [t-shirt](https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/299058000/WhatsApp+Image+2021-03-16+at+09.36.49.jpeg?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200) I bought from their label at the time) and have loved their groovy, psychedelic noise ever since. They are formed of 10 (yes ten) members which is honestly crazy to me, I do not know how they fit on any stages.

Just last Friday they released their 50 minute debut album [Earth-Sized Worlds](https://open.spotify.com/album/4cLeoigCgulrTWiYszW61K?si=CVe3aRTTQ8uLr0pritXo2w), which I cannot recommend enough, and is where the track of the week comes from. Also last Friday came Sam Fender's third studio album [People Watching](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Abecbed8BYAdHy9RaVoY7?si=mHSqnUxqT8uHrOoNvxqVNg), also a great album and one which made it difficult to pick my favourite song this week. I particularly like [Nostalgia's Lie](https://open.spotify.com/track/10MJWoKUV6AthUYR323MqB?si=8711c08855b4409c), but felt that it did not best the track I have selected. See you next week, where I look forward to hearing Sports Team's new album "Boys these Days" (the single [Bang Bang Bang](https://open.spotify.com/track/6SZiBRJYG3rd3yiU4PDsxZ?si=45a24f6883fa4e73) is simply amazing), I particularly look forward to the track "Maybe When We're Thirty" which was incredibly to hear live in a hometown venue back in November.

The track of the week:
