<p>This weekend I’ve been getting stuck into the coverage of glastonbury
(at least that which the bbc felt it didn’t have to intervene in for
some strange reason). I’ve really enjoyed experiencing lots of different
sets from the comfort of my home, especially while I get ready to move
soon, because what’s better for chores than good music. So I’ve picked
out a few of my favourite songs from various sets to share.</p>
<h3 id="god-gave-me-feet-for-dancing---ezra-collective">God Gave Me Feet
For Dancing - Ezra Collective</h3>
<p>Having heard many good things about Ezra Collective and liking a few
of their recorded songs, I decided to listen into their set. It’s
probably of the best vibes I’ve seen from a live set and that’s without
even being there. For this particular song (and a couple before it),
they brought out a large band from two youth clubs, it was probably the
most wholesome thing they could do. You could tell everyone on that
stage was enjoying it, bouncing around and dancing to the incredible
music they were playing. I could help but dance along too in my own room
because it was just so good. If you have the time I highly recommend
watching their whole set because it is just so good.</p>

Recorded Version</a></p>
<h3 id="english-teacher---toothpick">English Teacher - Toothpick</h3>
<p>As you may well know by now English Teacher are really special to me
- I’ve seen them maybe 4 or 5 times live, so when I watched their set at
Glastonbury I was quite surprised they were playing a new song. I feel
like this is quite a rarity for them and I was very excited. It turns
out I was rightly so, Lily introduces the song to be “about a shark
biting off your leg” which I found quite funny. The song feels like a
culmination of all their previous work, especially tracks like Albert
Road and This Could Be Texas. It’s one of their calmer tracks but it
hits so hard and if this is what their new material will sound like,
then I am very excited for their future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no recording of this, but the song starts
around 14:55 in the bbc recording <a

<h3 id="lola-young---one-thing">Lola Young - One Thing</h3>
<p>I think Lola Young has a lot of very cool stuff coming out at the
moment. I really enjoyed her album “This Wasn’t Meant For You Anyway”,
particularly tracks like “You Noticed” (the track I almost picked) and
“Wish You Were Dead”, and she continues the trend of great music with
her new songs coming out. <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6KFQdIB3njXBQNcg1xUh9U?si=7ca55e35e1d44321">One
Thing</a> is one of these and you can tell just how much love there is
for that song based on the volume of the crowd’s singing. I think Lola’s
love for being on stage also shines through, she is really giving it her
all and has some amazing dance moves. The set is such good vibes and I
thoroughly enjoyed it!</p>

<h3 id="franz-ferdinand-master-peace---hooked">Franz Ferdinand &amp;
Master Peace - Hooked</h3>
<p>The title here is very apt - I am hooked on this music. The staccato
synth in the background, the strong leading guitar and Alex Kapranos’
vocals all just give such a catchy fun song. Although the recorded
version does not feature Master Peace, they had him as a guest for
Glastonbury (and apparently also Glasgow), I think the mix of rap and
rock is such a fun and interesting combination. One similar track I like
in this style is the collaboration between the Arctic Monkeys and Dizzee
Rascal, <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3fcJX31CLvMOzcWR0HFn8B?si=c86e056aad29493a">Temptation
Greets You Like Your Naughty Friend</a>, a combination which seems
really weird on paper but meshes so insanely well. I feel this same vibe
is brought across here and goes so well in the live form, a brilliant
performance from both artists.</p>
