As inspired by my friend (and webring neighbour) Abi, I decided to make a more light hearted blog post answering the same questions as she did in [hers](https://www.akpain.net/blog/ten-pointless-facts/).

## Do you floss your teeth?

Nope. I get told to every time I go to the dentist, think "hmm yes that would probably be a good idea" and promptly forget instantly. I also feel like it would be too weird a feeling and would freak me out.

## Tea, coffee, or water?

I almost exclusively drink water, but am partial to a nice Yorkshire tea from time to time. Though currently I have no regular tea in, so I'm drinking chai at the moment which is a nice change.

## Footwear preference?

Trainers, I have other shoes for other purposes, but these are the most comfortable and go with most things I wear.

## Favourite dessert?

I used to love sweet things, but have slowly grown out of it, so desserts are a bit of a weird thing to me now. I think what makes a good balance is a carrot cake or maybe a nice sponge (mmm pineapple upside down cake).

## The first thing you do when you wake up?

Mainly just struggle to get up for an hour.

## Age you'd like to stick at?

I think it's hard to say right now given I've lived so little of my life. I like to imagine I would make a great grandma given most of my hobbies, but who knows?

## How many hats do you own?

Two (I think), I have a very worn and sun bleached cap which I have had for many years and which I take with me on all my walking trips. It weirdly got dust stained last time I wore it, so it has some strange orange blobs on the otherwise grey base. The other hat I have is a winter beanie that I never wear because it fits weirdly and doesn't work with having hair up.

## Describe the last photo you took?

The last photo I took (at least that I didn't delete) is one sat on a bench next to a tarn near where I live. There are a luscious set of trees lining the waters edge and at least half a dozen ducklings. Not pictured, is the book I was reading: "An Introduction to Cybercultures" and the lovely people who wandered by and said hi to me (something I miss when I go down south for university).

## Worst TV show?

If you have been on my page in recent months you would know that I hate "Prime Target" for just how nonsensical is. I don't think this makes it the worst TV show I've watched, but it certainly annoyed me. The worst TV show I've watched is probably that one season of Love Island I was weirdly attached to during my A-Levels. No I don't know why I wanted to watch it, maybe because it was so mind numbing it helped me relax after revising all day?

## As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?

I don't remember a lot of the aspirations I had as a child, but I do particularly remember wanting to open a lego store with one of my friends, where we would have robot lego figures that would serve customers.

When I was older I do remember wanting to become an engineer, mainly because it was a maths heavy field (I hadn't realised yet that you could do mathematics research). That all fell apart at A-Level physics and the discovery of computer science.
