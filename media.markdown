Here are my opinions on some current media I am currently consuming!

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [A taste of linear logic](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/lineartaste/lineartaste-revised.pdf)

The books I am currently reading include:

> The Jungle - Upton Sinclair

I am re-reading this classic so I can write a review. I think it covers an interesting and important range of topics and I hope to get much out of it than last time I read it. Particularly because I am trying to improve my sense of important themes and ideas from books, a skill I have wanted to have for a while.

> An Introduction to Cybercultures - David Bell

Of what I have read so far Cybercultures covers a good deal of interesting topics. I think the language at times can be difficult to parse because of the academic nature of the text, but I have enjoyed the extra reading and the discussions on various ideas. These include how cyberspace will change communities and how it affects our daily lives. A section I haven't got to yet, but one I am excited for is that of identity.

I think this book offers a particularly interesting view because it is from 2000 and so where predictions occur it is interesting to see how accurate they are. It is also interesting to see how certain topics stay very much the same albeit with different context.

### Song of the Week

> To see the archive of previous weeks, see here: [Archive](/media/song-archive)

This week we're bringing it back to the basics and just focusing on a few songs I've been enjoying recently.

Alright first up, some new stuff! Earlier this week I discovered a band called Slow Fiction. I say discovered, but I know of their most popular track, Apollo, but this was the first time I listened to them as a band specifically. In particular, I've been listening to their EP "Crush". It's a fun mix of indie rock and different paces, from the high energy [Monday](https://open.spotify.com/track/7xPq717gjyeHgvsreftBHr?si=e37585c82e1344bf) to the slower [There Were Stars in Your Eyes](https://open.spotify.com/track/01ZyxPFB1XvG5x3E5gtoMW?si=2f32f06c006e4bb8). I have been enjoying Monday in particular, it has a sort of Sprints energy to it, with these sort of rushed feeling lyrics that let loose at the chorus with a strong "Get Out!", the guitars run wild and fast in the background and the drums are great.

Now an oldie, this week I've travelled a fair amount because I've been on holiday. On one of my long train journeys I stumbled back across Lime Garden, a band I've loved for a long time (probably close to 4 years), but have forgotten about recently. Easily my favourtie song of theirs is [Clockwork](https://open.spotify.com/track/3BOiQtFYI4EE27CyNwm9rU?si=405accc621424e15), in particular I love the strong drums, which hit even more hard live. I really remember the last time I saw them just really getting into this song and mostly because the drums just felt so good to hear live and loud. It helps that the lyrics are very fun to sing along to too.

Ok, a bit of a rogue one here for the last song. As I was looking more into Slow Fiction I realised they had a single with Speedy Wunderground, a label run by Dan Carey who do singles with lots of up and coming bands. I often like these singles so it's fun to look at the new ones and the past singles have some huge names: Moreish Idols, English Teacher, Kae Tempest, Black Country, New Road and Royel Otis. Anyway I was looking up who Dan Carey had produced for because that list is also pretty crazy and through this I rediscovered Black Midi, more specifically their album "Hellfire". This was an album I listened to a lot a couple years back, but haven't really listened to since, it's a really interesting punky and weird album. One of my favourite songs from this album is [Welcome To Hell](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ON8SSEFQtnhftaRAOt9Wl?si=7132b9242e9a4cf1), it's got a weird squealy intro which descends into Greep's typical storytelling-esque voice. I love the grandiose feel to the song and the chaotic repetitive guitars and drums throughout. It's so strange but so fun to listen to because it's ever changing, but it all blends so well together.

Song of the week:

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:

- Gilmore Girls
- Dungeon Meshi
- Heartbreak High (particularly enjoying the autism representation)

I would like to get round to re watching the Matrix trilogy (but not the new one - that's bad).

I recently also watched (in a movie marathon) all of the star wars episodes from 1-9. I will now give my ranking of these films (with a little comment for each), I hope you enjoy :)

1. A New Hope: A classic and well written film, good fun!
2. Return of the Jedi: The film is well written, interesting and cool to watch. Bonus points for ewoks, I love those guys.
3. The Phantom Menace: I have a lot of nostalgia from playing the lego star wars podracing which means I'm a bit biased, but also this is a great film anyway (if you just ignore jar jar binks existing and the stupid "there's always a bigger fish line" what were they on about)
4. The Empire Strikes Back: I do not like that the problem the whole time was just the millennium falcon breaking, stupid and annoying, I don't like Han.
5. The Clone Wars: C3PO getting turned into a robot was pretty fun
6. Revenge of the Sith: Noo, nooo, NOOOOO! You shall die (this did not justify why Anakin switched to the dark side at all, he just kinda went yup I guess I'll do that)
7. The Force Awakens: I thought the little attempt at looking at how stormtroopers were actually people was interesting until that dialogue abruptly just stopped.
8. The Last Jedi: Felt like a rehash of the empire strikes back but much worse (why did Leia just fly through space what the hellll)
9. The Rise of Skywalker: We watched this film at 1.5x speed to make it in any way watchable

I also recently watched The Accountant 2... I think we all know how that went based off of the less than great autism representation in the first film.
