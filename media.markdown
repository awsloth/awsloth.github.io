Here are my opinions on some current media I am currently consuming!

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [A taste of linear logic](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/lineartaste/lineartaste-revised.pdf)

The books I am currently reading include:

> The Jungle - Upton Sinclair

I am re-reading this classic so I can write a review. I think it covers an interesting and important range of topics and I hope to get much out of it than last time I read it. Particularly because I am trying to improve my sense of important themes and ideas from books, a skill I have wanted to have for a while.

> An Introduction to Cybercultures - David Bell

Of what I have read so far Cybercultures covers a good deal of interesting topics. I think the language at times can be difficult to parse because of the academic nature of the text, but I have enjoyed the extra reading and the discussions on various ideas. These include how cyberspace will change communities and how it affects our daily lives. A section I haven't got to yet, but one I am excited for is that of identity.

I think this book offers a particularly interesting view because it is from 2000 and so where predictions occur it is interesting to see how accurate they are. It is also interesting to see how certain topics stay very much the same albeit with different context.

### Song of the Week

> To see the archive of previous weeks, see here: [Archive](/media/song-archive)

This week I got back into a few of the artists I used to listen to a few years ago, namely Hozier, Orla Gartland and Lime Cordiale. So I figured hey, why not take a look at each of their respective first albums.

First up Hozier, who is most certainly the most famous out of them all and is most notable for "Take Me to Church", which was incredibly popular when it was first released. For me it is most notable for being the accompanying song to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozs_f4ZT9sw) incredible dance performed by Sergei Polunin. I remember being showed this by my dance teacher at the time and just being in awe at how powerful he was, I really enjoy the non-standard movements and breaks to build up character to the performance. My favourite move is *of course* the weird foot slide at 2:19, it's genuinely incredible because I have no idea how to do it and it's quite jarring but so smooth at the same time! What a cool video (and location!!!) and of course to such a great song too. To talk about my favourite track on the album; I love [Jackie and Wilson](https://open.spotify.com/track/5xo1Gj4WTssjQgQ0w03cf2?si=8b8ace4ba9824572) because of the drums that are front and center with accompanying electric guitar that just feels so so great to listen to. As we pull into the chorus, we get a choral backing into Hozier's brilliant vocals which then drop as we get back to the lovely guitar and drums. Maybe not a typical Hozier song, but it's a really dun style and unique because of it. If you somehow have not listened to this album (what are you doing???) I cannot recommend enough a whole listen through because Hozier's voice is just so incredible and the songs on this album are simply amazing.

Next up we have Orla Gartland. The first song I heard from Orla Gartland was actually in form of one of her music videos [You're Not Special, Babe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgAvGT28lqc), it's fun and I like the choreography (the clown makeup is cool too ofc). It's a song that has taken a little while to hit with me, because I would listen to the lyrics and think it's just silly, but re-listening to it again recently I get it. Do what you want, you're not special it doesn't matter, just embrace it! Orla then subsequently released her first album and it's a little parasocial, but I remember watching her release stream where she played a couple songs on her acoustic guitar and just thinking about how cool she was to be releasing stuff on her own label and how talented she was. The whole following summer I listened to the album on repeat, I distinctly remember it being my go to when I was on holiday. Listening back now I know so many of the lyrics just because of how much I listened to it. I remember my favourite at the time was [Madison](https://open.spotify.com/track/3GNnTQVqE4zUSECYzHXq0b?si=913ace15beec43f1), probably just because of the lyric "Can I be .... your houseplant in the corner" which was very iconic to me at the time. I think I just liked the stripped back-ness of the song and how you could just hear Orla sing incredibly well. My favourite now is [Bloodline / Difficult Things](https://open.spotify.com/track/5H4GjjQta6rgKNr2vxRvEl?si=1153c3e8ccc34208) it's a two part song and it's so beautiful to me. The first half "Bloodline" talks about parental relationships, with an incredible leading guitar and backing drums. This leads through with a short audio clip from a video of Orla as a child into "Difficult Things", which is much more stripped down and calmer. I really relate to the lyrics in this section, which then builds up into this cacophony of sound. It's a really well rounded song and the two halves fit together so well.

Last but not least is Lime Cordiale. There's not much to Lime Cordiale for me, their music is just pretty upbeat, silly and fun to listen to. They're probably best known for [Robbery](https://open.spotify.com/track/5iAxcPoyxt0HWU5sZToqe5?si=f61480020c3c4ed4) a song of their second album, but they're from Australia, so if you haven't heard of them that's probably why. For a few picks from the album I would choose [Is He Your Man](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ddm4Ghw3wHpt8xCtr11cZ?si=0d969e2e1ce94123), [Temper Temper](https://open.spotify.com/track/3DCU0R5FFaB9GKxZERb5wr?si=6d8f3082bf3243e3), [Other Way Round](https://open.spotify.com/track/1wg5FJiijOFoUa2sIzBKKP?si=0b089889b507437c) and [Giving Yourself Over](https://open.spotify.com/track/07peU6LhEVd9IyPhEIFlrD?si=fd8e7eb5e63b442c). The album is full or rocking side to forth music with some quality additions from trumpet and piano along the way.

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:

- Gilmore Girls
- Dungeon Meshi
- Heartbreak High (particularly enjoying the autism representation)

I would like to get round to re watching the Matrix trilogy (but not the new one - that's bad).

I recently also watched (in a movie marathon) all of the star wars episodes from 1-9. I will now give my ranking of these films (with a little comment for each), I hope you enjoy :)

1. A New Hope: A classic and well written film, good fun!
2. Return of the Jedi: The film is well written, interesting and cool to watch. Bonus points for ewoks, I love those guys.
3. The Phantom Menace: I have a lot of nostalgia from playing the lego star wars podracing which means I'm a bit biased, but also this is a great film anyway (if you just ignore jar jar binks existing and the stupid "there's always a bigger fish line" what were they on about)
4. The Empire Strikes Back: I do not like that the problem the whole time was just the millennium falcon breaking, stupid and annoying, I don't like Han.
5. The Clone Wars: C3PO getting turned into a robot was pretty fun
6. Revenge of the Sith: Noo, nooo, NOOOOO! You shall die (this did not justify why Anakin switched to the dark side at all, he just kinda went yup I guess I'll do that)
7. The Force Awakens: I thought the little attempt at looking at how stormtroopers were actually people was interesting until that dialogue abruptly just stopped.
8. The Last Jedi: Felt like a rehash of the empire strikes back but much worse (why did Leia just fly through space what the hellll)
9. The Rise of Skywalker: We watched this film at 1.5x speed to make it in any way watchable

I also recently watched The Accountant 2... I think we all know how that went based off of the less than great autism representation in the first film.
