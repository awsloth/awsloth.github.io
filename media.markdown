Here are my opinions on some current media I am currently consuming!

## Literature

Current papers I am looking at include:

- [A taste of linear logic](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/lineartaste/lineartaste-revised.pdf)

The books I am currently reading include:

> The Jungle - Upton Sinclair

I am re-reading this classic so I can write a review. I think it covers an interesting and important range of topics and I hope to get much out of it than last time I read it. Particularly because I am trying to improve my sense of important themes and ideas from books, a skill I have wanted to have for a while.

> An Introduction to Cybercultures - David Bell

Of what I have read so far Cybercultures covers a good deal of interesting topics. I think the language at times can be difficult to parse because of the academic nature of the text, but I have enjoyed the extra reading and the discussions on various ideas. These include how cyberspace will change communities and how it affects our daily lives. A section I haven't got to yet, but one I am excited for is that of identity.

I think this book offers a particularly interesting view because it is from 2000 and so where predictions occur it is interesting to see how accurate they are. It is also interesting to see how certain topics stay very much the same albeit with different context.

### Song of the Week

> To see the archive of previous weeks, see here: [Archive](/media/song-archive)

This week I decided to pick back up my liked songs playlist. I try to put songs on there if they particularly mean something to me at the time I come across them. So it was an interesting hodgepodge of feelings listening back to the playlist. I've picked out a few that felt similar to what I was feeling this week or just wanted to talk about.

A couple songs from Flyte caught my eye, I think their folk indie vibe can be really emotional and they really lean into this. Their cover of [Archie, Marry me](https://open.spotify.com/track/0rcwROyUguj5RQa5pPKajI?si=7612b969c57e435d) from Alvvays is so different that I can listen to the cover and the original as songs in their own right. It was this song that got me into their music, with the long drawn out echoey vocals all on their own, joined later by backing vocals and then finally synths that feel almost organ like, it's really beautiful.

I think with Flyte I relate less with the lyrics, but kinda of wallow about in their sound and absorb the emotions and feelings they emanate. I've saved [Faithless](https://open.spotify.com/track/2zElUqN4ITr3sU2AliHuyK?si=f218a3cbaa1745d8) and [I've Got a Girl](https://open.spotify.com/track/3ySqbiPCsnKAL6BCq4aOrD?si=57ab538307054835), the latter coming form their album "This is Really Going to Hurt", a really tragic and depressing album, about the singer falling out of a relationship. This isn't something I relate to loads, but you can feel the amount of emotion poured into this song and others on this album.

Another song that caught my eye was [Golden Dream](https://open.spotify.com/track/57tFTt7bkxQ1vvaPy1kgSF?si=55b8a56b9eb7463a), a song which I'm not too sure about the lyrics. For me they are there to sing along to and feel the song along to. Mainly I think the ending is why I liked the song in the first place, the little build up to the elongated singing of "stupid, stupid, stupid me, me, me, me". It's simple, but it's raw and it feels, a lot.

The last song, and the song of the week is [Sinking Feeling](https://open.spotify.com/track/0fuaSbG0dUdtfKCKQWCA3s?si=91b7aad1133b4ba3). Unlike the other songs I've picked I think I relate to the lyrics of this one almost too much. I think hearing it when I was only a year older than that mentioned in the song ("I'm only nineteen, already burned out") it really hit. I think there's some sort of expectation to have everything together all the time and it seems ridiculous to write it down, but it's nice to know that I'm not alone in this feeling. Overall, I think it's really a cathartic song to just hear some of your fears sang by someone else, it makes you feel a lot less alone. I chose this song because everything is feeling kinda up in the air right now and it's stressing me out a lot. I'm not sure exactly what "sinking feeling" Chloe is describing, but a strong pit in the stomach certainly feels something like what I would say is a sinking feeling.

## Films and TV

I have recently been enjoying:

- Gilmore Girls
- Dungeon Meshi
- Heartbreak High (particularly enjoying the autism representation)

I would like to get round to re watching the Matrix trilogy (but not the new one - that's bad).

I recently also watched (in a movie marathon) all of the star wars episodes from 1-9. I will now give my ranking of these films (with a little comment for each), I hope you enjoy :)

1. A New Hope: A classic and well written film, good fun!
2. Return of the Jedi: The film is well written, interesting and cool to watch. Bonus points for ewoks, I love those guys.
3. The Phantom Menace: I have a lot of nostalgia from playing the lego star wars podracing which means I'm a bit biased, but also this is a great film anyway (if you just ignore jar jar binks existing and the stupid "there's always a bigger fish line" what were they on about)
4. The Empire Strikes Back: I do not like that the problem the whole time was just the millennium falcon breaking, stupid and annoying, I don't like Han.
5. The Clone Wars: C3PO getting turned into a robot was pretty fun
6. Revenge of the Sith: Noo, nooo, NOOOOO! You shall die (this did not justify why Anakin switched to the dark side at all, he just kinda went yup I guess I'll do that)
7. The Force Awakens: I thought the little attempt at looking at how stormtroopers were actually people was interesting until that dialogue abruptly just stopped.
8. The Last Jedi: Felt like a rehash of the empire strikes back but much worse (why did Leia just fly through space what the hellll)
9. The Rise of Skywalker: We watched this film at 1.5x speed to make it in any way watchable

I also recently watched The Accountant 2... I think we all know how that went based off of the less than great autism representation in the first film.
