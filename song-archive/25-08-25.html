<p>This week we’re bringing it back to the basics and just focusing on a
few songs I’ve been enjoying recently.</p>
<p>Alright first up, some new stuff! Earlier this week I discovered a
band called Slow Fiction. I say discovered, but I know of their most
popular track, Apollo, but this was the first time I listened to them as
a band specifically. In particular, I’ve been listening to their EP
“Crush”. It’s a fun mix of indie rock and different paces, from the high
energy <a

to the slower <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/01ZyxPFB1XvG5x3E5gtoMW?si=2f32f06c006e4bb8">There
Were Stars in Your Eyes</a>. I have been enjoying Monday in particular,
it has a sort of Sprints energy to it, with these sort of rushed feeling
lyrics that let loose at the chorus with a strong “Get Out!”, the
guitars run wild and fast in the background and the drums are great.</p>
<p>Now an oldie, this week I’ve travelled a fair amount because I’ve
been on holiday. On one of my long train journeys I stumbled back across
Lime Garden, a band I’ve loved for a long time (probably close to 4
years), but have forgotten about recently. Easily my favourtie song of
theirs is <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3BOiQtFYI4EE27CyNwm9rU?si=405accc621424e15">Clockwork</a>,
in particular I love the strong drums, which hit even more hard live. I
really remember the last time I saw them just really getting into this
song and mostly because the drums just felt so good to hear live and
loud. It helps that the lyrics are very fun to sing along to too.</p>
<p>Ok, a bit of a rogue one here for the last song. As I was looking
more into Slow Fiction I realised they had a single with Speedy
Wunderground, a label run by Dan Carey who do singles with lots of up
and coming bands. I often like these singles so it’s fun to look at the
new ones and the past singles have some huge names: Moreish Idols,
English Teacher, Kae Tempest, Black Country, New Road and Royel Otis.
Anyway I was looking up who Dan Carey had produced for because that list
is also pretty crazy and through this I rediscovered Black Midi, more
specifically their album “Hellfire”. This was an album I listened to a
lot a couple years back, but haven’t really listened to since, it’s a
really interesting punky and weird album. One of my favourite songs from
this album is <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5ON8SSEFQtnhftaRAOt9Wl?si=7132b9242e9a4cf1">Welcome
To Hell</a>, it’s got a weird squealy intro which descends into Greep’s
typical storytelling-esque voice. I love the grandiose feel to the song
and the chaotic repetitive guitars and drums throughout. It’s so strange
but so fun to listen to because it’s ever changing, but it all blends so
well together.</p>
