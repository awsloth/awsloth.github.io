            <p>This week I got back into a few of the artists I used to listen to a
            few years ago, namely Hozier, Orla Gartland and Lime Cordiale. So I
            figured hey, why not take a look at each of their respective first
            albums.</p>
            <p>First up Hozier, who is most certainly the most famous out of them
            all and is most notable for “Take Me to Church”, which was incredibly
            popular when it was first released. For me it is most notable for being
            the accompanying song to <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozs_f4ZT9sw">this</a> incredible
            dance performed by Sergei Polunin. I remember being showed this by my
            dance teacher at the time and just being in awe at how powerful he was,
            I really enjoy the non-standard movements and breaks to build up
            character to the performance. My favourite move is <em>of course</em>
            the weird foot slide at 2:19, it’s genuinely incredible because I have
            no idea how to do it and it’s quite jarring but so smooth at the same
            time! What a cool video (and location!!!) and of course to such a great
            song too. To talk about my favourite track on the album; I love <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5xo1Gj4WTssjQgQ0w03cf2?si=8b8ace4ba9824572">Jackie
            and Wilson</a> because of the drums that are front and center with
            accompanying electric guitar that just feels so so great to listen to.
            As we pull into the chorus, we get a choral backing into Hozier’s
            brilliant vocals which then drop as we get back to the lovely guitar and
            drums. Maybe not a typical Hozier song, but it’s a really dun style and
            unique because of it. If you somehow have not listened to this album
            (what are you doing???) I cannot recommend enough a whole listen through
            because Hozier’s voice is just so incredible and the songs on this album
            are simply amazing.</p>
            <p>Next up we have Orla Gartland. The first song I heard from Orla
            Gartland was actually in form of one of her music videos <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgAvGT28lqc">You’re Not Special,
            Babe</a>, it’s fun and I like the choreography (the clown makeup is cool
            too ofc). It’s a song that has taken a little while to hit with me,
            because I would listen to the lyrics and think it’s just silly, but
            re-listening to it again recently I get it. Do what you want, you’re not
            special it doesn’t matter, just embrace it! Orla then subsequently
            released her first album and it’s a little parasocial, but I remember
            watching her release stream where she played a couple songs on her
            acoustic guitar and just thinking about how cool she was to be releasing
            stuff on her own label and how talented she was. The whole following
            summer I listened to the album on repeat, I distinctly remember it being
            my go to when I was on holiday. Listening back now I know so many of the
            lyrics just because of how much I listened to it. I remember my
            favourite at the time was <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3GNnTQVqE4zUSECYzHXq0b?si=913ace15beec43f1">Madison</a>,
            probably just because of the lyric “Can I be …. your houseplant in the
            corner” which was very iconic to me at the time. I think I just liked
            the stripped back-ness of the song and how you could just hear Orla sing
            incredibly well. My favourite now is <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5H4GjjQta6rgKNr2vxRvEl?si=1153c3e8ccc34208">Bloodline
            / Difficult Things</a> it’s a two part song and it’s so beautiful to me.
            The first half “Bloodline” talks about parental relationships, with an
            incredible leading guitar and backing drums. This leads through with a
            short audio clip from a video of Orla as a child into “Difficult
            Things”, which is much more stripped down and calmer. I really relate to
            the lyrics in this section, which then builds up into this cacophony of
            sound. It’s a really well rounded song and the two halves fit together
            so well.</p>
            <p>Last but not least is Lime Cordiale. There’s not much to Lime
            Cordiale for me, their music is just pretty upbeat, silly and fun to
            listen to. They’re probably best known for <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5iAxcPoyxt0HWU5sZToqe5?si=f61480020c3c4ed4">Robbery</a>
            a song of their second album, but they’re from Australia, so if you
            haven’t heard of them that’s probably why. For a few picks from the
            album I would choose <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2ddm4Ghw3wHpt8xCtr11cZ?si=0d969e2e1ce94123">Is
            He Your Man</a>, <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3DCU0R5FFaB9GKxZERb5wr?si=6d8f3082bf3243e3">Temper
            Temper</a>, <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1wg5FJiijOFoUa2sIzBKKP?si=0b089889b507437c">Other
            Way Round</a> and <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/track/07peU6LhEVd9IyPhEIFlrD?si=fd8e7eb5e63b442c">Giving
            Yourself Over</a>. The album is full or rocking side to forth music with
            some quality additions from trumpet and piano along the way.</p>
