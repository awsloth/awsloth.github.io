            I am also currently reading the Iliad, translated by Emily Wilson. I've really enjoyed the general introduction and translator's note so far which give great context to the poem and help with understanding. I am a few books at the moment and am finding it both accessible and really interesting, something well worth reading for sure.

            <p>
            It's been a while since I've written one of these (literally the start of november - I just checked).
            But I recently watched "I Saw the TV Glow" with my good friend Sof and it has so solidly settled into
            my head that I simply <i>have</i> to write about it. To be honest, I'm still somewhat speechless about it and
            it's something I don't think I'll ever stop thinking about.
            </p>

            <p>
            I was so stuck into the film whilst watching it that I don't think I said more than about 20 words the whole almost 2 hours it was on. It just grasped me and would not let go. When the film finished, I had no words and just had to sit with it in silence for a good while. The whole rest of the day I could almost feel it there sitting with me.
            </p>
            <p>
            Without giving away too many spoilers, I think what makes it feel so important to me is how it takes that feeling - the one where you are suffocating and everything is zooming past you and you feel like you are dying - and says this is uniquely horrifying. It says that yes that feeling is deserving of a whole horror movie. Not just that, but it is so unabashedly a trans film and I think that's so important. The whole thing feels mostly comforting in some way. To be honest if you ask me again in a months time I will probably be talking about it different aspect because I will be thinking about it more. I don't say it lightly when I say this is easily one of my favourite, if not the most important films of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now to get onto the more relevant part (at least to this) - the music. Man did I love the music of this film. Maybe in part because it felt reminiscent of ethel cain at times - to the point where I was waiting for something from here to show up. I thoroughly enjoyed both the individual songs on the OST, but most importantly the whole film score done by alex g is simply breathtaking. It's so so beautiful and I really cannot recommend enough taking a listen through. 
            </p>
            <p>
            To name a few of my favourite songs from the OST:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3ha9yXEYY9lBZEVXD3sYzG?si=1bbae27f99624987">Starburned and Unkissed</a> - this song is so ingrained in my memory of the film for reasons I can't quite put my finger on. It helps that it is a banger to be honest.</li>
                <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/716fRFVWfmElwFqamBBusY?si=5a4ba9d479504847">How Can I Get Out?</a> - Gloomy, slow, guitar led music <i>and</i> it's six minutes long. They know how to get me that's for sure.</li>
                <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7xS4iFz0s1N6NFebtWnLON?si=51d110ea296043c2">Claw Machine</a> - I feel like it is hard <i>not</i> to pick this song. "I think I was born bored / I think I was born blue / I think I was born already missing you". They did a great job getting Phoebe Bridgers on this soundtrack because damn do her songs make me feel things and this is no exception, it hits.</li>
            </ul>

            Then a few of my favourite songs from the score:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0mM4Pn8NBEATWoqffuPUBT?si=6f7866a7ec3847dc">Ice Cream Transformation</a> - for such a short song, this is so memorable. It's probably because the scene it's from is so memorable, but I just love that the same sounds that run through the rest of the film can feel so serene, so hopeful.</li>
                <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2HStyw7zf7wFbhofDYmwde?si=64a48463ffb54365">Planetarium (Outside)</a> - eughh the noise of it all. This is sooo delicious, the little build ups that go nowhere, the fizzing towards the end it's right up my street and I love it.</li>
                <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4iPaGTdS63o0ISsCTmChcc?si=4145825420a34802">Planetarium (Inside)</a> - pretty similar to the outside. They got that hurdy gurdy ass instrument that is in all the music I'm loving right now. It's haunting in all the right ways. I can't stop listening to this pair on repeat, they're sooo good.</li>
            </ul>

            My song of the week:
